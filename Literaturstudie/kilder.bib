	abstract = {Construction A non-buoyant {ROV} for underwater use has been developed. It is heavy and powerful and is normally suspended in a wire from a crane. The operation of the {ROV} is from the deck and the control signals and power are fed through umbilical cable which is kept taut at all times. The {ROV} is equipped with 3 thrusters placed 1200 apart and operating in the horizontal plane. With the aid of a joystick, the operator can deflect the Spider with load, away from the vertical. The load and Spider may also be rotated. Working tools may be placed on this particular {ROV}.},

	abstract = {Unoccupied Underwater Vehicles ({UUVs}) are growing in importance and capabilities. Here, the trajectory control of an {UUV} carrying an object is investigated, with the consequent changes in system dynamics. For the ﬁrst time, an Adaptive Model Predictive Control ({AMPC}) scheme for {UUVs} is developed, which selects optimal actions at the start of every time step to minimise the trajectory tracking error and prevent excessive changes in the control action over a receding time horizon. Prediction error minimisation is used to identify the linear model of the {UUV} in real time. The performance of {AMPC} is compared with existing {PID} and sliding-mode control ({SMC}) strategies through simulations. The latter is improved to prevent integral wind-up. While {SMC} results in best tracking performance, it imposes a strong burden on the motors due to its bang-bang action selection. {AMPC} presents smoother changes in applied thrust, but higher tracking errors due to non-linear eﬀects and inaccuracies in the on-line system identiﬁcation process. {PID} presents best overall performance, but its behaviour is expected to degrade on an actual {ROV} application due to sensor noise. This study will contribute to the selection of a suitable control scheme for future {UUVs} performing maintenance tasks autonomously.},

	abstract = {Increasing autonomy, eﬃciency and safety for Remotely Operated Vehicles ({ROVs}) is crucial for future subsea operations and requires accurate models for optimal control, operations and design. This involves precise modeling of the cable in conjunction with the {ROV} response. This paper presents a novel three-dimensional cable model for Remotely Operated Vehicles using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The presented model is implemented in Matlab and takes into account the most important eﬀects related to the response of underwater cables and {ROVs}. Following beam theory bending stiﬀness is also included, making the model applicable for low tension scenarios. The presented model is modiﬁed to allow for compression of the cable. The resulting non-linear equations are discretized spatially by the Galerkin ﬁnite element method and solved temporally by the Newmark-β time integration scheme.},

	abstract = {The expansion of subsea applications demands extended use of autonomous capabilities within Remotely Operated Vehicles ({ROVs}), which can reduce the overall operation time and cost. Obtaining a simple but also reasonably precise model is important for an autonomized control strategy. This study outlines a low-dimensional model structure for a commercial underwater inspection {ROV}, based on simplifying physical assumptions. The respective model parameters are obtained from experimental data. Tuning parameters are then introduced in order to further improve the accuracy of the identiﬁed model. Based on a model validation it is concluded that the obtained model contains the main properties of the {ROV}.},

	abstract = {Human-in-the-loop ({HITL}) system is referred to as a promising technology to extend human actions and intelligences to deep ocean. Many applications of {HITL} demand the remotely operated vehicle ({ROV}) to track a desired target point. However, the cyber- and physical-constrained characteristics on {ROV} make it challenging to achieve the tracking task. This paper is concerned with a tracking control problem for the {ROV}, subjected to time-varying delay in cyber channels and actuator saturation in physical channels. We design a model-free proportional-derivative ({PD}) controller to enforce the position tracking of {ROV}. For the proposed controller, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions are constructed to analyze the stability, and then the sufficient conditions are provided to show that the tracking controller can stabilize {ROV}. In order to estimate and optimize the domain of attraction ({DOA}), the stability conditions are rearranged into a form of linear matrix inequalities ({LMIs}), through which the required initial stability conditions can be developed. Finally, simulation and experiment results are performed to validate the effectiveness. It is demonstrated that the designed tracking controller can guarantee asymptotic stability, while the {DOA} in this paper can be significantly enlarged as compared with the other ones.},

A viable, efficient solution is given by robotic platform that couple autonomous surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles in integrated structures with various levels of cooperation. In this paper, we describe a number of field tests on the surface component of a robotic platform consisting of an autonomous surface vehicle that can automatically deploy and recover a small remotely operated vehicle. The aim of the tests are to assess the main functionality of the navigation, guidance and control system of the vehicle in relation to basic navigation tasks, both in supervised and in fully autonomous mode. In particular, in order to assure cooperation with the deployed remotely operated vehicle, the ability to track a target is considered.},

	abstract = {Dynamical positioning ({DP}) control of a remotely operated vehicle ({ROV}) using thrusters is investigated as a means to increase operability of its launch and recovery system ({LARS}) on relatively small surface vessels. The {ROV} uses its {DP} control system to dynamically track the wave-driven motion of the surface vessel that may also be under {DP} control. We consider the critical phase when the {ROV} position is very close to the {LARS}. In this phase, the {ROV}’s motion is strongly influenced by first-order surface waves and hydrodynamic couplings from the surface vessel motion. Hence, there is risk of collision between the {ROV} and the surface vessel and its {LARS}. We employ a time-domain dynamic system simulator that calculates the coupled motions of both the surface vessel and the {ROV} to analyse and optimize the operability of the system. It is based on coupled added mass, damping and wave force response amplitude operators ({RAO}) for both the surface vessel and the {ROV}, which can be calculated using {WAMIT} coupled hydrodynamic multi-body computations, accounting also for the moonpool water column dynamics. Simulation results show the positive effect of the {ROV} {DP} on the operability of the {LARS} using statistical environmental data from the North Sea.},

For large-scale exploration, a lander or an unmanned surface vehicle ({USV}) is paired with one or more autonomous underwater vehicles ({AUVs}), while the liberated research vessel R/V can transport the manned submersible to another area for diving operations. When manned submersibles and {AUVs} perform small-scale accurate measurements, the research vessel R/V supports both submersible types for diving operations and has a positioning and communication time allocation mechanism for cooperative operations. Through the analysis of the operating efficiency of different modes, we found that the cooperative operational mode based on the pure research vessel R/V is suitable for local small-scale accurate detection, and the cooperative operational mode based on the {USV}/lander system is suitable for large-scale and long-distance underwater operations.},
