Abstract
In this study, (1) change in the concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) leached from polycarbonate (PC) tube to control water (BPA free), seawater and river water at 20 and 37 °C as a function of time, (2) the fate of BPA caused by addition of H2O2 and Fe3+ to seawater containing BPA leached from PC tube were assessed. BPA leached from PC tube to all water samples increased with the ascendant of temperature and with the passage of time. The BPA leaching velocity in seawater was the fastest in three samples (11 ng/day for seawater, 4.8 ng/day for river water 0.8 ng/day for control water at 37 °C).
BPA leaching velocity from PC tube was significantly high at pH 8 (50 mM Na2HPO4) and increased dose-dependently. There was no difference in the velocity of BPA among the 50 mM phosphate-buffers at pH 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. BPA was leached three times higher by addition of Na+ than K+. However, the higher the K+ concentration, the larger the BPA leached from PC tube. Na+ mixed with PO4− was effective on BPA leaching from PC tube, but not with SO4− or Cl−. The results suggested that BPA leaching from PC tube would be attributed to the concentration of bibasic phosphate such as Na2HPO4 and K2HPO4 in water samples. BPA was degraded in both control water and seawater in the presence of radical oxygen species, but the degradation rate was lower in seawater than in control water, suggesting that anti-oxidative system exists in seawater. Neo-synthesized substance in both control water and seawater in the presence of reactive oxygen species was identified as BPA-quinone by LC–MS.

1. Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a compound widely used as the monomer for the production of polycarbonate (PC) plastics such as baby bottles, and as a major component of epoxy resin for lining of food cans and dental sealants (Staples et al., 1998). To date, there were many reports detected in environmental things, water (Gonzalez-Casado et al., 1998; Staples et al., 1998), baby food bottles (Mountfort et al., 1997), plastic waste (Yamamoto and Yasuhara, 1998), and living things including human (Olea et al., 1996; Miyakoda et al., 1999). In particular, the release of resin components such as BPA and BPA dimethacrylate in oral environment from dental composites and the safety of these compounds in human have raised controversy and concern in dentistry (Soderholm and Mariotti, 1999). Sajiki et al. (1998) observed a significant volume of BPA was leached to sheep plasma from PC tube at body temperature and suggested that BPA might be highly soluble in body fluid such as plasma and saliva.
A safety of BPA, has become a controversial issue because it cause not only estrogenic endocrine-disrupting effect (Krishnan et al., 1993; Brotons et al., 1995), but also various diseases including carcinogenesis (Ashby and Tennant, 1988; Suarez et al., 2000). There are many reports concerning the disorders of reproductive organs when rats and mice were exposed to BPA in prepubertal period (Vom Saal et al., 1998; Stoker et al., 1999; Takao et al., 1999; Long et al., 2000).
Kadoma and Fujisawa (2000) assumed that BPA might be oxidized by a radical interaction in the dental resin system, from the kinetic evaluation of reactivity of BPA derivatives as radical scavengers for methacrylate polymerization. Atkinson and Roy (1995) proposed an involvement of radical intermediate, BPA semiquinone, in the production of DNA adduct using rat liver in the presence of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide in vitro. These results suggest that BPA would be oxidized in biological samples and BPA metabolites in radical form might affect adverse influences to animals mentioned above.
Nowadays, over 200 000 tons of BPA is estimated to be produced every year in Japan (Kamiura et al., 1997). Environmentally, a rapid increase in the distribution and abundance of plastic debris in the ocean around the world was reported and an adverse influence of plastic debris on aquatic animal has been of great concerned (Colton et al., 1974; Wong et al., 1974; Ogi et al., 1999). Although it is considered that microbial populations such as gram-negative bacteria called MV-1 acclimate to degrade BPA (Staples et al., 1998) and that BPA is effectively removed from BPA containing wastewater using electrochemical oxidation in a high NaCl and high pH (Boscolo Boscoletto et al., 1994), there are few researches concerning the fate of BPA leached from plastic debris to the aquatic environments like ocean. Sajiki and Yonekubo (2002) reported that BPA was degraded in water containing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical and the degradation rate increased further by addition of physiological and environmental concentration of NaCl, probably due to the formation of HOCl. Thus, the fate of BPA in the aquatic environment is an interesting issue.
In this study, the amount of BPA leached from PC tube to seawater or river water as a function of time was investigated and BPA-quinone formation in the course of BPA degradation by ROS in seawater was identified using LC–MS.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Seawater was obtained from the coast of Pacific Ocean and Tokyo Bay of Chiba Prefecture in November 2000 and February 2001. River water was obtained from the surface near the bank of Miyako-river in Chiba Prefecture in February 2001. These water samples were kept in glass bottles at 5 °C. Experiments were done within 2 weeks after water sampling. Throughout the experiment, BPA-free water where BPA was removed by ODS-silica Sep-pak (Waters, MA, USA) after deionization of tap water using Milli-RX12 α (Nihon Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) was used as control water. PC centrifuge tubes (
110×16mm2
 I.D.) were purchased from Nalgenunc International (Tokyo, Japan). BPA (>95%) and other chemicals of special grade were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Hydrogen peroxide (31%, w/v) was from Mitsubishi Gas Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3 · 6H2O) and HPLC-grade acetonitrile and distilled water were purchased from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). To avoid contamination of BPA, glass tubes were rinsed with 99% ethanol (EtOH) before use. Oasis HLB (Waters, MA, USA), a sample extraction cartridge, used for the solid phase extraction of BPA was pre-washed with 3.5 ml EtOH and 3.5 ml water. The eluent of Oasis HLB with ethyl acetate was evaporated and checked for contamination before use. In every analysis, blank test using BPA free water was done to make sure there is no contamination.
2.2. Preparation of samples
2.2.1. Leaching of BPA in water samples from PC tube
Ten milliliter of each water sample was put into individual PC tubes and allowed to stand at 20 and 37 °C for a specified period. One milliliter of sample was weekly taken from each tube for BPA assay.
2.2.2. In vitro degradation of BPA by reactive oxygen species
Superoxide anion (O2−) and hydroxyl radical (HO) were produced by the reaction of H2O2 with FeCl3 · 6H2O (Fenton reaction). BPA degradation was carried out by addition of 100 μl each of 0.03–0.9 M H2O2 and 0.004–0.4 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O to 100 μl water samples (control water, river water, seawater and the seawater leached BPA from PC tube at 37 °C for 23 days) and being allowed to stand at room temperature (18–20 °C) for 40–60 min.
2.3. Analytical parameters
2.3.1. Extraction and determination of BPA from samples
Isolation of BPA from samples was done according to the method of Sajiki et al. (1999). The samples were applied to Oasis-HLB, and polar lipids were removed from the column with 3.5 ml 15% EtOH and 3.5 ml petroleum ether was used to remove nonpolar lipids after washing with 3.5 ml water. Finally, BPA was eluted with 3.5 ml ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated under N2. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml acetonitrile–water (40:60) solution. HPLC systems, Model LC-10 AD (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with Shim-Pack VP-ODS column (
150×4.6mm2
 I.D., Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and ED (Coulochem II 5200A, ESA, MA, USA), was used for BSA analysis. Solvent system was acetonitrile-50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3) (40:60). Flow-rate and column temperature were 1.0 ml/min and 40 °C, respectively. Injection volume was 50 μl. Conditions of ED were guard cell potential; E 600 mV, analytical cell potentials; E1 300 and E2 550 mV, sensitivity; 1 μA, respectively. Identification of BPA was made by comparing the HPLC retention time of BPA peaks with that of the authentic standards. For a complete identification, the BPA peaks eluted by HPLC were confirmed using GC–MS (QP-5000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after the silylation with bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and co-chromatography using authentic standards. The limit of detection in HPLC-ED was 0.2 ng/ml (C.V.=2.9, S/N=3.0 (n=5)). Quantitative analysis of BPA by HPLC-ED was carried out using the data by LC–MS detection. A coefficient of correlation between BPA peak areas (100–1000 ng/ml) by the two detections was 0.998.
2.3.2. LC–MS condition
BPA and its metabolites were identified using HPLC system, a Alliance 2690 (Waters, MA, USA) with a Symmetry C18 column (
150×2.1mm2
 I.D.) equipped with Waters 996 Photodiode array UV/VIS detector and a ZQ with MK II Z-spray mass spectrometer (Waters, MA,USA). LC–MS separation and detection were performed in simple isocratic solvent system as follows; Mobile phase: distilled water––acetonitrile (65/35), flow rate: 0.25 ml/min, sample injection volume: 10 μl, column and sample temperature: 40 and 7 °C, respectively. Electrospray negative mode was used for the MS detection of BPA and their metabolites. All peaks were detected at 33 V cone voltage. Source block and desolvation temperature was 90 and 390 °C, respectively. Data was analyzed using Waters Masslynx software. The limit of detection in LC–MS was 0.1 ng/ml (C.V.=7.0, S/N=3.1 (n=5)). Quantitative analysis of BPA by LC–MS detection was carried out using the data by traditional LC-UV detection. A coefficient of correlation between BPA peak areas (100–1000 ng/ml) by the two detections was 0.939. A within-run precision (%RSD) using seven times injections for 5 ng/ml BPA was 0.95. The calibration curve linearity in a range of 5–1000 ng/ml was 0.996.
2.3.3. Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed according to one-way analyses of variance, and the difference among treatments at the level of 1% was tested by least significant difference.
3. Results
The pH of control water, river water and seawater at 20 °C were 7.1, 7.6 and 7.1, respectively. BPA concentrations in water samples from the Pacific Ocean, Tokyo bay and river were 0, 0.1 and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively. Change in BPA concentration in three water samples (seawater of Pacific Ocean, river water and control water) leached from PC tubes at 20 and 37 °C as a function of time is shown in Fig. 1. The BPA values in all samples increased time- and temperature-dependently. There was no difference in BPA concentrations leached from PC tube to seawaters between Pacific Ocean and the Tokyo Bay. Ratios of the value at 37 °C to that at 20 °C on day 46 were 5.6:1 for control water, 22:1 for river water and 17:1 for seawater. Leaching velocity of BPA from PC tube was as follows; seawater (1.6 ng/ml/day at 20 °C and 11 ng/ml/day at 37 °C) > river water (0.2 ng/ml/day at 20 °C and 4.8 ng/ml/day at 37 °C) > control water (0.15 ng/ml/day at 20 °C and 0.8 ng/ml/day at 37 °C). Change of leaching velocity of BPA from PC tube as a function of pH from 6.5 to 8.0 using 50 mM Na2HPO4 and 50 mM KH2PO4 is illustrated in Fig. 2. Leaching velocity was the highest at pH 8 (Na2HPO4 only) and the lowest at pH 6.5 (KH2PO4 only). There was no difference in the velocity of BPA leached for 14 days among P-buffers at pH 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. Change in the concentration of BPA leached from PC tube to Na2HPO4 solutions as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3. BPA concentration increased linearly in the three different dosed Na2HPO4 for 15 days. BPA leaching velocities to 1, 10, and 100 mM Na2HPO4 were 0.7, 7.1 and 33.6 ng/ml/day, respectively. Change in BPA concentrations in waters containing various kinds of salt in PC tube allowed to stand at 37 °C as a function of time is shown in Table 1. BPA leached from PC tube to all samples increased time-dependently. BPA was leached three times higher by addition of Na+ than by K+. Na+ mixed with PO4− was effective on BPA leaching from PC tube, but not with SO4− or Cl−. The higher the K+ concentration, the larger the BPA leached from PC. There was no significant difference among the BPA concentrations leached to 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na2SO4, 50 mM KH2PO4 and control water for 14 days.

The difference of BPA recovery in water and seawater in the presence and absence of ROS was investigated. When 114 ng/ml BPA was added to water or seawater followed by allowing to stand at 20 °C for 60 min, the recoveries were 94.7% or 96.7%, respectively. When the same amount of BPA was added to water or seawater in the presence of low level ROS consisting 0.03 M H2O2 and 0.13 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O and high level ROS consisting 0.03 M H2O2 and 0.26 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O, BPA recoveries were 63.3 and 12.9% for control water, 100 and 55.2% for seawater. The low BPA recovery in the presence of high level of ROS indicates that the higher the ROS concentration, the faster the BPA degradation. BPA concentration in seawater leached from PC tube at 37 °C for 23 days was 448.3 ng/ml. For measurement of BPA degradation, the same was added with 0.1 M H2O2 and 0.0015–0.15 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O and allowed to stand at 20 °C for 40 min. Results showed that percentages of BPA degradation were 0 at 0.0015 mM, 5.1 at 0.015 mM and 99.3 at 0.15 mM.
BPA metabolites in control water containing ROS (0.1 M H2O2, 0.4 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O mixed with 1 μg/ml BPA were identified using LC–MS. Fig. 4 shows the HPLC chromatograms of BPA degraded by ROS at 20 and 40 min after the reaction. A BPA peak at the retention time of 8.9 min decreased and neo-synthesized peak at around 6 min increased reaction time-dependently. This neo-synthesized peak intensity increased dose-dependently up to 100 min and finally 40% of BPA was degraded. Spectra of BPA (A) and neo-synthesized oxidative compound (B) are illustrated in Fig. 5. Spectrum patterns of A and B at 20 and 40 min after the reaction were completely the same. The base peak in spectra of (A) was pseudomolecular ion (M–H)- of BPA (m/z=227). The base peak in spectra of (B) was at 241 m/z and the fragment ion at 226 m/z (M–H–Me) was also detected. The neo-synthesized peak with the same retention time and spectra was also detected in seawater sample with BPA reacted with ROS at 20 °C.

4. Discussion
We reported that plasma facilitated BPA leaching from PC tube at 37 °C, a body temperature and high amount of BPA was detected in commercial sera stored in plastic containers (Sajiki et al., 1999). Other researchers also reported a BPA leaching to many environmental samples other than bio-samples such as blood and saliva. In the present study, we found a phenomenon that BPA was easily leached from PC tube to seawater at 37 °C. As the velocity of BPA leaching from PC tube to seawater depends on the temperature, amount of BPA leached from plastic debris to seawater even at low temperature could not be ruled out. BPA leaching from plastic debris would become a serious matter of concern in the seashore in especially summer time and in tropical area.
We reported that BPA leaching velocities to sheep plasma or human serum from the same kind of PC tubes as used in this study at 37 °C were 41.4 or 46.2 ng/ml/day, respectively (Sajiki et al., 1999). BPA leaching velocity to seawater was around four times lower than that to sheep plasma or human serum. From the result in this study, leaching velocity of BPA seems to be related to the concentration of phosphoric salts, but not to sulfuric or chloric salts. Moreover, sodium ion was more effective in BPA leaching from PC tube than potassium ion, which might support the result that BPA leaching velocity to seawater was higher than river water. Since seawater contains sodium three times more, but phosphorus 500 times lower than human serum, it is suggested that phosphorus play an important role on BPA leaching from PC plastic. Thus, BPA leaching velocity might be attributed to the balance of minerals contained in water sample, especially sodium and phosphorus.
BPA is considered as degradable compound in the environment. We observed in in vitro that BPA in water was degraded rapidly in the presence of ROS at 20 °C and further degraded by an addition of 0.9–3% NaCl, whereas, EtOH inhibited the decrease in the BPA recovery, suggesting that NaCl could accelerate BPA degradation and EtOH could play the role of scavenger of ROS on BPA degradation (Sajiki and Yonekubo, 2002). In this study, BPA was not degraded easily in seawater, inspite of the 3% salts contained in seawater. The reason why BPA could not be easily degraded by ROS in seawater compared to control water would be due to some existing scavengers in seawater. Furthermore, BPA leached from PC tube to seawater was also degraded in the presence of ROS and the same BPA metabolite as water sample was detected (data not shown), suggesting that BPA would be degraded if ROS occur in seawater. In the coastal area of Japan, it has been reported that harmful and toxic algal blooming occurred occasionally and a concentration of primary amines such as putrescine, one of growth factor of bloom-forming phytoplankton, had positive correlation to phytoplankton cell numbers in such blooming (Nishibori et al., 2001). On the other hand, marine phytoplankton oxidizes the primary amines to produce extracellular hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes via amine oxidase, cell-surface enzyme (Palenik and Morel, 1991). BPA might be degraded under such circumstances rich in ROS of bloom-forming phytoplankton in the coastal water where plastic debris accumulates.
In the present study, pH of seawater at 7.1 seemed lower than that of the ocean which is generally at pH 8.0. The low pH might be due to the incorporation of CO2 from air in the process of handling. The pH was determined 2 days after the water was collected.
Generally, it is considered that BPA is degraded to BPA quinone, probably via catechol followed by the formation of semiquinone in vivo. Atkinson and Roy (1995) reported that BPA is oxidized to a reactive metabolite, 4,5-bisphenol-o-quinone by the reaction with potassium nitrosodisulfonate (Fremy’s salt) and major DNA adducts increased in the rat liver DNA in the presence of peroxidase activation system using autographs of polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC map. They also proposed the possible BPA metabolism including the intermediacy of BPA-semiquinone (SQ) involved with oxidation system for understanding the BPA-induced toxicity. Satoh et al. (1999) also observed that BPA-enhanced semiquinone radical (SQ), one of the toxic metabolites, using ESR spectroscopy in the mixture of BPA and hydroquinone (HQ) which is a model of oral environment with BPA-related dental resins at an uncurable stage. As shown here, in water samples, it was implied that neo-synthesized oxidative compound formed in the presence of ROS which was more hydrophilic than BPA and gave base ion at 241 m/z on ESI negative mode detection, is BPA quinone. This compound also showed other ion at 243 m/z, suggesting that BPA could be metabolized via the following reversible equilibration between BPA-o-quinone (MW=242) and BPA-o-catechol (MW=244) (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6. Possible reversible equilibration between BPA-o-quinone and BOA-o-catechol. Reaction was carried out at 20 °C. A 1 μg/ml BPA was reacted with 0.1 M H2O2 and 0.44 mM FeCl3 · 6H2O at 20 °C. Analytical details were in Section 2.

BPA degradation pathway in water samples in the presence of ROS looks like the metabolic manner depicted by Atkinson and Roy (1995) using biological samples. In this study, it was impossible to detect BPA-semiquinone radical. Quinones produced from benzene, aromatic hydrocarbons, estrogens and catecholamines are considered to be highly redox active molecules, which can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species and correlate with the known pathology of the parent compounds (Bolton et al., 2000). Fate of BPA in the aquatic environment and the safety for aquatic organisms are great concerns in the future because of a rapid increase in the distribution and abundance of plastic debris in the ocean around the world.

Plastics in soil: Analytical methods and possible sources
2018, Science of the Total Environment
Citation Excerpt :

Such methodological advances, however, are urgently needed to be able to quantify the toxicity of plastic in soil via dose-response relationships as well as its fate and thus future exposure risks. Once plastic has entered soil and environment, it threatens ecosystems by e.g., releasing toxic and endocrine substances like bisphenol A (Sajiki and Yonekubo, 2003). Furthermore plastic is a sorbent for other toxic pollutants like heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (Frias et al., 2010; Ashton et al., 2010; Engler, 2012; Velzeboer et al., 2014).
