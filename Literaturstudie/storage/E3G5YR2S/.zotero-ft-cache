Foreword
The role of the International Association of Geomorphologists is to support innovative research in the field of geomorphology and the young researchers involved in such subjects. Seafloors of oceans are the last unexplored part of our planet. Technological progress has made the exploration of such environments increasingly accurate. Geomorphology is one of the key disciplines involved in this exploration. This is why the Submarine Geomorphology working group was set up during the 8th International Conference on Geomorphology of the International Association of Geomorphologists, which took place in Paris in August 2013. The objectives of this working group are to establish submarine geomorphology as a field of research, disseminate its concepts and techniques among earth scientists and professionals, and encourage students to develop skills and knowledge in this field. This book is a first, important step towards achieving these objectives. Involving more than 60 academics and practitioners worldwide, this book provides a detailed review of the state of the art of the study of submarine landforms and processes, extending from shallow coastal environments to deep abyssal plains. It also presents the principal methods used to investigate submarine landscapes, and the key research questions that need to be addressed in the near future. I believe this book constitutes a valuable tool for students and professionals alike to achieve a thorough understanding of a rapidly evolving, and increasingly significant, field of geomorphology. A fascinating book to read!

Introduction

1 Our Blue Planet
Extending from the coastline to the deepest oceans, the submarine realm constitutes more than the 70% of our planet. The ocean comprises 1334 million cubic kilometres (320 million cubic miles) of seawater, comprising 97% of Earth’s available water and covering 361 million square kilometres (139 million square miles) of seafloor (Costello et al. 2015; Trujillo and Thurman 2016). The vast majority of this seafloor cannot be directly observed by humans. Technological progress, particularly during the last century, has resulted in an explosion of knowledge on the marine realm that has radically transformed our view of the ocean and our planet in general. The ocean is today a less remote and more fascinating place than it was 70 years ago. However, it still represents a frontier for research and resource exploitation. We have better maps of the surfaces of Mars, Venus and Earth’s Moon than of our seafloor. Most of the ocean floor is mapped at a spatial resolution of only a few kilometres (Smith and Sandwell 1997), which means that the majority of the fine-scale submarine landforms are still uncharted. Surveying such landscapes is

both expensive and time consuming; it has been estimated that it would take approximately 125 years to chart all ocean basins using the latest swath-mapping tools (Sandwell et al. 2002).
2 Submarine Geomorphology
Geomorphology is the study (-logy, from koco1) of the forms (-morpho-, from loquη) of the Earth (geo-, from cη). Geomorphologists describe and classify the Earth’s surface to investigate the complex interaction between form and process, and to unravel the evolution of landforms and landscapes through space and time. Submarine geomorphology is the study of landforms and processes in the submarine domain. The ocean hosts a tremendous variety of forms that reflect the action of a range of tectonic, sedimentary, oceanographic and biological processes at multiple spatio-temporal scales (Fig. 1). The aim of this book is to present the state-of-the-art in the standard data and methods used in submarine geomorphology (Part 1), to introduce the most significant submarine landforms and the processes that form them (Part 2), and to highlight the applied value of submarine geomorphology to industry and ocean governance based on selected examples (Part 3). This book is written for anybody with an interest in submarine geomorphology, although it is primarily aimed for undergraduate and graduate students, and professionals with limited training in marine geosciences. Our hope is that this book will encourage an interaction with terrestrial geomorphologists as well as scientists from other disciplines that results in significant advances in submarine geomorphology. The investigation of the form, processes and evolution of submarine landscapes has strong basic and applied value, and it is becoming a priority for many academic and research institutions, government authorities and industries globally. The seafloor is a vast reservoir of renewable and non-renewable resources, which include marine ecosystems, fisheries, hydrocarbons, freshwater, aggregates, deep sea minerals and blue energy, among others. Industries that exploit these resources are increasingly moving offshore and deeper as the shallow and more accessible resources become depleted. Sound knowledge of seafloor geomorphology is key to maritime spatial planning, the designation of marine protected areas, the construction and operation of offshore infrastructure, and the implementation of environmental monitoring programmes. Seafloor processes constitute a geohazard to key offshore infrastructure and coastal communities. The seafloor is also an important archive of global change (e.g. climate, ocean circulation, sea level). The International Association of Geomorphologists has recognised the increasing significance of submarine geomorphology by setting up the Submarine Geomorphology working group in August 2013. This group joins other initiatives, such as S4SLIDE (Assessing Geohazards, Environmental Implications and

3 History of Submarine Geomorphology
Submarine geomorphology is a relatively young scientific discipline. This is largely a result of the difficulties inherent to the investigation of the ocean floor. Submarine geomorphology has relied heavily on ‘remote sensing’ of the ocean floor, primarily through the use of acoustic waves. Developments in submarine geomorphology have therefore been closely linked to developments in geophysics. The first pioneers to measure the depth of the ocean did so using plumb lines. A time consuming and inaccurate method, this involved a weight attached to cable that was lowered to the seafloor while the ship was stationary. The length of the cable was used to estimate the depth of the ocean floor. The first known attempt to measure ocean depth in this manner was by Ferdinand Magellan in the central Pacific around 1500 AD, but his attempt failed because the plumb line he used was too short. Lt. Matthew Fontaine Maury published the first deep-sea bathymetric map based on measurements with plumbs in 1855 (Fig. 2). This map covers the North Atlantic Ocean and is based on sparse soundings. Maury included a bathymetric profile between Mexico and NW-Africa along an area with a relatively high density of soundings. This profile showed numerous important morphological features, such as

the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the first indications of typical continental margin and abyssal plain morphologies. Another 100 years had to pass before these features could be understood in the frame of the theory of plate tectonics. The first great oceanographic expeditions also took place in the second half of the 19th century. The Challenger Expedition, for example, circumnavigated the globe from 1872–1876 and made nearly 500 deep soundings using a lead weight attached to a hemp rope. During this time, several attempts were made to mechanise depth soundings and make them less time consuming and expensive. This was partly driven by the need to lay down the first transatlantic cables. One technique was developed by William Thomson and consisted of a motorised drum of piano wire with a lead and a dial. Another instrument was the gravity-measuring bathometer developed by Siemens (1876), but it failed to achieve the accuracy of plumb lines and was never routinely used. In view of the lack of detailed morphological maps of the ocean, scientists in the late 19th century joined forces to study the ocean floor systematically. During the 7th International Geographic Congress in Berlin in 1899, a proposal was made to develop an international agreement on nomenclature and systematic terminology for sub-oceanic relief features. In response to this proposal, a commission was formed and charged with the preparation of a bathymetric map of the oceans. In 1903, His Serene Highness Prince Albert I of Monaco offered to organise and finance the production of a map series named ‘la Carte générale bathymétrique des océans’ (the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, GEBCO) (Carpine-Lancre et al. 2003). This was the origin of GEBCO, which nowadays operates under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO. GEBCO today offers a 30 arc minute grid (ca. 1 km), which is an important reference map for the morphology of the world’s oceans. A milestone in the investigation of submarine geomorphology was the development of ocean echo sounders in the early 20th century. These instruments allowed measuring water depth from moving vessels by means of acoustic waves. The invention of echo sounders happened independently at two places (Wille 2005). The Canadian engineer Reginald A. Fessenden started the development of an acoustic echo ranging device in Boston in 1912. German physicist Alexander Behm built his first echo sounder in Kiel in 1913. Both workers were stimulated by the loss of the Titanic after a collision with an iceberg in 1912. The main aim of both developments was the detection of icebergs and obstacles with acoustic waves. Alexander Behm failed with his approach to detect icebergs with horizontal sound propagation, but vertical soundings allowed very precise measurements of water depth. Several ships were equipped with echo sounders soon afterwards. A first echo sounding line crossing the Atlantic Ocean was collected on the USS Stewart in 1922 using an acoustic echo sounder devised by Dr Harvey Hayes, a U.S. Navy scientist. The German Meteor Expedition (1925–1927) systematically surveyed the South Atlantic Ocean by crossing it 13 times between 20° north and 55° south using echo sounding equipment and other oceanographic tools. In total, they collected about 67,000 soundings along lines spaced at 600 km. This expedition showed for the first time

that ocean floors have irregularities as great as suberial landscapes. The continuity of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was proven beyond doubt during this expedition. Sediment coring during this cruise also led to the first estimates of sedimentation rates in the deep ocean. The first operational multibeam sounding system was installed on the USNS Compass Island (Glenn 1970). For the first time, detailed bathymetric maps of the ocean floor became available, which revolutionised our understanding of seafloor morphology and seafloor processes (see Chapter “Multibeam Echosounders”). The first marine seismic measurements were conducted in 1938 (Ewing and Vine 1938). Ewing was one of the pioneers in the development of seismic reflection and refraction systems for the exploration of ocean basins. Early measurements were done from stationary vessels with explosives as source. Early marine seismic measurements imaged thick sedimentary successions on the continental shelves, which quickly drew the attention of the hydrocarbon industry. Major technical achievements in the investigation of the oceans were made during World War II, mainly in relation to the detection and safe navigation of submarines. Some of the engineers moved to academic institutions and private companies after the end of the war, thus making the newly developed techniques available to civil society. An important step for the investigation of submarine geomorphology was the invention of sidescan sonars, which permitted the acquisition of seafloor images at significantly high resolutions (see Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”). The Geological Long-Range Inclined Asdic GLORIA came in service in the late 1960s, and it was used to map large portions of the seafloor, including the entire Exclusive Economic Zone of the continental United States. These and other surveys significantly contributed to the improved morphological analysis of continental margins and other seafloor features such as Mid-Ocean Ridges (Laughton 1981). The increasing availability and quality of seafloor maps led to pioneering work on various aspects of submarine geomorphology. Francis Parker Shepard, an American sedimentologist, became well known for his work on the origin of continental margins and submarine canyons (especially along the US continental shelves and slopes), as well as the first global statistical study of seafloor morphology. Jaques Bourcart carried out similar work offshore France, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea. The global hypothesis for ocean margin morphology was developed by a meteorologist—Alfred Wegener—whose hypothesis of continental drift is now an integral part of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. The theory of seafloor spreading was consolidated by the work on flat-topped seamounts (guyots) by Harry H. Hess, and the mapping carried out by Bruce C. Heezen and Marie Tharp.1 The famous seafloor map published by Heezen and Tharp in 1977 is a
1In the early years of their cooperation, Bruce C. Heezen used to collect the data aboard the research vessels while Marie Tharp drew the maps, as women were excluded from seagoing activities at that time. It was only in 1965 that Marie Tharp was able to join a data collection expedition. As quoted in “The Floor of the Sea” by William Wertenbaker (1974), Bruce Heezen related the following story concerning the realisation that a rift valley existed in the middle of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge: “Marie’s job for me was to decide what a structure was... In three of the transatlantic profiles she noticed an unmistakable notch in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and she

masterpiece that illustrates all the major morphological elements of plate tectonics (Fig. 3). This map is surprisingly accurate even in areas where no data were available at that time. Heezen’s work is extremely diverse—it extended to all parts of the world and covered both broad and fine scale submarine geomorphology. Reported in more than 300 publications, Heezen’s work has left an indelible mark on submarine geomorphology. A milestone in marine geosciences was the initiation of the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) in 1966 using the Drilling Vessel Glomar Challenger (Chapter “Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling”). Ocean drilling is not a direct method for investigating submarine geomorphology, but the analysis of rock and sediment sampling contributes to the understanding of the processes shaping the seafloor. DSDP was followed by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, 1983–2003), the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP, 2003–2013), and the ongoing International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP, since 2013). All of these programs are truly international and multidisciplinary endeavors that significantly contribute to the understanding of the ocean floor and planet Earth in general.

decided they were a continuous rift valley and told me. I discounted it as girl talk and didn’t believe it for a year”. “Marie was the grand dame of ocean exploration,” said Bill Ryan, Doherty Senior Scholar at Lamont-Doherty and a long-time colleague of Tharp’s. “She didn’t just make maps; she understood how the Earth works”.
Introduction 7


Several technological advances in the last few decades have allowed investigating submarine geomorphology in increasing detail. Major advances include the use of underwater vehicles (see Chapter “ROVs and AUVs”), the accurate navigation of surface vessels and underwater vehicles, and improved resolution and penetration of acoustic imaging tools. As a result, modern submarine geomorphic investigations are based on a wide range of techniques (Fig. 4). The main strength of these techniques is that they provide an insight into both the exterior and interior structures of submarine landforms. The first part of this book presents the most commonly used techniques for data collection in submarine geomorphology.

Sidescan Sonar
Ingo Klaucke
Abstract Sidescan sonar allows obtaining an acoustic image of the seafloor at high resolution, wide swath and relatively low cost. For that purpose the backscattered signal of an acoustic pulse sent out sideways from an instrument carrier is registered. At low incident angles small-scale relief is well imaged and the length of shadows allows calculation of the height of seafloor features but sidescan sonar is particularly useful in mapping compositional differences of the seafloor. Sidescan sonar images are, however, mostly uncalibrated and need some form of ground-truthing for meaningful geological interpretation. Interferometric sidescan sonar systems now also provide bathymetric information together with backscatter strength.
1 History of Sonar
The acronym Sonar stands for SOund NAvigation and Ranging and was coined during WW II in analogy to Radar or Radio detection and ranging. The use of sound for the detection of obstacles such as icebergs or submarines, however, dates back to developments made in the aftermath of the sinking of RMS Titanic and WW I (Hackmann 1985). The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden and independently Alexander Behm in Germany developed the first working echosounders (Wille 2005). In an echosounder piezoelectric elements transform an electrical pulse into an acoustic signal and vice versa. Behm in particular intended his sonar for the detection of icebergs, which did not work out because of too many reflections from surface waves. His invention, however, quickly turned out to be useful for measuring the depth of the seafloor. The first experiences with side-scan sonar were carried out by Hagemann (1958) but his work for the US Navy was kept secret and only published in 1980. Based on Hagemann’s work, a first side-looking sonar (called the Shadow Graph) was built

by a company specialised in military equipment (Westinghouse) in the early 1960s (MIT Museum 2016). At the same period in Great Britain sound was also used for imaging the seafloor (Chesterman et al. 1958) and soon later a first sidescan sonar was built for the National Institute of Oceanography (Tucker and Stubbs 1961), which is now part of the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. Additional experiments with side-looking sonar were carried out by Harold Edgerton, an electrical engineer at MIT who had become famous for using stroboscope flash lighting in photography in order to make fast moving processes visible. Building on this experience, he used sound to “image” the seafloor with repeating acoustic pulses and via his company EG&G worked on several projects for the US Navy (MIT Museum 2016). Very quickly, sidescan sonar proved to be a valuable tool for the systematic investigation of the seafloor and the generation of seafloor image mosaics (Clay et al. 1964) showing much hitherto unknown details (Belderson et al. 1972). The earliest commercial sidescan sonar systems were used for marine archaeological purposes, in particular the search for sunken ships (Bass 1968; Rosencrantz et al. 1972). At the end of the 1960s the evolution of sidescan sonar to that point culminated in the construction of the Geological Long-Range Inclined Asdic GLORIA (Rusby 1970; Somers et al. 1978), which was capable of achieving up to 60 km wide swaths by using a 6.5 kHz signal. From 1984 onwards the US Geological Survey started mapping the entire Economic Exclusive Zone of the continental United States. The resulting mosaics were the first systematic inventory of major areas of the seafloor (EEZ-Scan 84 Scientific Staff 1986; EEZ-Scan 85 Scientific Staff 1987; EEZ-Scan 87 Scientific Staff 1991) and spawned a wealth of scientific discoveries (Garder et al. 1996 and references therein). Further information can also be found at the USGS web page http://coastalmap.marine.usgs.gov/ gloria/. Similar long-range, 6.5–12 kHz systems (SeaMARC-II, Hawaii MR-1) and mid-range, 30–35 kHz (SeaMARC-I, TOBI) sidescan sonar systems were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s for different research institutes, but the instruments were also used commercially (Kosalos and Chayes 1983; Huggett and Millard 1992). Sidescan sonar then underwent a phase of quiet evolution and constant improvements rather than evolutionary steps. This evolution was driven by commercial manufacturers and included the use of digital rather than analogue recording of the data, the use of increasingly higher frequencies for shallow water applications, and the use of frequency-modulated (chirp) signals that allow a better signal-to-noise ratio and less power consumption than the traditional pulse. The next major step in the development of sidescan sonar was the more widespread use of interferometric sonar systems that use two or more parallel receiver arrays that allow calculating bathymetry from phase differences of the signal received by the different receivers (Blackinton et al. 1983). These interferometric sidescan sonars originally achieved swath widths of up to 7 times the towing altitude and less resolution than multibeam systems (de Moustier 1988), but advances in signal processing now allow modern systems calculating interferometric bathymetry over the entire swath, i.e. up to 15 times the towing altitude.

To obtain high-resolution imagery along-track either the pulse repetition rate is high or the speed of the system travelling through the water must be decreased. In addition the along-track beam angle must be low. A high pulse repetition rate will restrict the distance the pulse can travel, therefore be usually used with higher sonar frequencies. The high sonar frequencies however have strong signal attenuation and consequently a limited range. The beam angle, on the other hand, is a function of the length of the transducer, as long transducer arrays produce a narrower beam. The length of transducers, however, is limited by the length of the towfish. More recently the development of synthetic aperture sonar allowed major improvements in the along-track resolution of sidescan sonar systems. These new systems have a high pulse repetition rate and allow calculation of a large synthetic transducer length. This technique requires very high precision in towfish position and altitude. The synthetic aperture sonar has been recently combined with a parametric signal that has been used for quite some time in sediment echosounding (see Chapter “Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods” for more information) in order to derive sidescan sonar imagery from both parametric and the primary signals (Zakharina and Dybedal 2007).
2 Principles of Sidescan Sonar
In sidescan sonar systems an acoustic pulse with a narrow opening angle in the along-track and wide opening angle in the across-track direction is emitted sideways from either a vessel, a towed body or an autonomous vehicle (Fig. 1). Upon reaching an interface with sufficient acoustic impedance contrast, such as the seafloor, most of the acoustic energy will be reflected away from the instrument. At the same time multi-directional scattering will occur at the interface and some of the scattered energy will be scattered back to the instrument. This backscattered energy carries the information that is used in sidescan sonar imaging. As for all sonar systems this can be described by the active sonar formula:
BS 1⁄4 SL  2TL þ TS
where BS is the backscatter strength, SL the source level, TL the transmission loss and TS the target strength. The backscatter strength depends on a number of factors including the angle of incidence, the roughness of the seafloor and the scattering behaviour of the material at the seafloor. However, depending on the frequency of the acoustic signal, not all acoustic energy will be reflected and scattered but some portion will also be refracted into the sediments and scattered at deeper interfaces (Fig. 1) resulting in volume backscatter to be registered. This effect increases with decreasing sonar frequency. The resolution of the sonar system is determined by the pulse length and sampling frequency for the across-track resolution (Fig. 2), and by the beam angle and

survey speed for the along-track resolution. The across-track resolution of analogue systems is given by:
X 1⁄4 cL
2 cos h 1⁄4 c
2B
where L is the pulse length of the transmitted pulse, h is the grazing angle, c is the speed of sound in water, and B is the bandwidth. The resolution of digital systems, on the other hand, is determined by the sampling frequency of the A/D converter. The along-track resolution is the width of the beam on the ground or the distance travelled by the transducer during the reception interval, whichever is less. The width of the beam on the ground is given by:
Y 1⁄4 Ru
where R is the range and u is the beam angle in radians. The along-track resolution consequently decreases with increasing range and the along-track resolution is generally much lower than the across-track resolution.
3 State of the Art
Long-range sidescan sonar systems such as GLORIA or the Hawaii MR-1 system have become obsolete by the continuous development of full ocean depth multibeam bathymetry systems (see Chapter “Multibeam Echosounders”). Mid-range, deep-towed systems such as SeaMarc-I, TOBI or the Russian MAK-I system have been retired as well, leaving just a few deep-towed systems working in the 75–120 kHz range on the market. Such systems provide up to 1500 m wide swaths and depending on survey speed allow processing the data with roughly 1 m pixel size. In the past, they were commonly installed on a neutrally-buoyant towfish but increasingly more systems are now used on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The majority of sidescan sonar systems on the market, however, are small, portable, high-frequency systems for use in relatively shallow water, i.e. on the continental shelves and upper slope areas. These systems operate with signal frequencies in excess of 200 kHz with some systems now exceeding 1 MHz. This choice of frequencies and depth ratings closely reflects the main usage of sidescan sonar, which includes marine archaeology, submarine cable and pipeline inspection, obstacle recognition and search and rescue operations, mine detection, marine habitat mapping, and marine geological and fisheries applications. Raw sidescan sonar data are commonly displayed as a water-fall image during data acquisition. However, a certain number of data processing steps have to be applied in order to derive georeferenced sidescan sonar mosaics of the seafloor. The effects of these processing steps should be known by the interpreter, as they may induce or enhance artefacts and distortions. Sidescan sonar instruments record the

acoustic amplitude at the receiver versus time. Historically the received signals were recorded on electro-static paper and high backscatter intensities corresponding to high electrical currents would burn the paper dark. Nowadays, with digital processing of the data, both positive (high backscatter is white and shadows are black) and negative representation of the backscatter data are possible. Verifying the display convention is therefore required before interpretation. Typical waterfall displays show no signal returns as the acoustic energy travels through the water column, followed by a strong signal including specular reflection from the seafloor beneath the instrument, being the closest reflecting object. As time increases, signals returning from further and further away give a complete swath of backscatter returns for the single ping. The received signal decreases in amplitude for increasing range due to the transmission losses in the water (Fig. 3). A time-varying gain (TVG) function is generally applied in order to highlight backscatter changes at far range. The raw sidescan sonar data are displayed as backscatter intensity versus time or sample number, which is the slant range and

D 1⁄4 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
R2  h2
p
where R is the slant-range distance and h the altitude of the instrument above the seafloor. This equation assumes a flat seafloor, but can induce distortion if this assumption is significantly invalid. Many sidescan sonar acquisition packages allow online display of the slant-to-ground-range correction, but this also cuts out the water column data that can contain valuable information such as fish schools, gas bubbles (Fig. 3), or nepheloid layers. Once the slant-to-ground-range correction has been applied, navigation, heading and attitude information are combined with the backscatter intensity values in order to correctly position the latter on a geographic map (Fig. 4). For this purpose, precise positioning is crucial, but the resolution of

Sidescan Sonar 19


sidescan sonar images, which can be smaller than 10 cm, frequently exceeds the navigational precision. In addition, physically correct positioning of each sidescan sonar pixel on the ground generally leads to blurred images that are difficult to interpret. For this reason, sidescan sonar images are based on smoothed track, heading and attitude values that induce a certain degree of distortion and inaccurate positioning. Precise positioning, however, becomes crucial for synthetic aperture sonars. Most sidescan sonar systems are positioned using a layback method, where the length and azimuth of the towing cable is combined with the ship’s position. More precise positioning requires the use of a range finder, transponders on the seafloor (long baseline system), an inertial navigation system, an ultra-short baseline system (for deep-towed sonars), or a combination of these systems. The interpretation of sidescan sonar images still relies on the experience of the user, as calibrated sidescan sonar images relating specific backscatter intensities to well-defined lithologies are generally not available. Although standard sidescan sonar systems do not provide bathymetry, relief can be deduced from sidescan sonar images using the length of shadows and the altitude of the instrument above the seafloor (Fig. 4). In addition, lateral incidence at the far range highlights even small scale relief. The real benefit of sidescan sonar, however, is the distinction of areas of different seafloor roughness that is directly related to lithological differences. In that way sandy deposits, for instance, can be distinguished from muddy environments even if no difference in relief is involved. Different software packages are available to aid the user in establishing different backscatter classes that ultimately require “ground-truthing” in order to derive a meaningful geological interpretation.

Note Alternating bands of high and low backscatter intensity (the halo) parallel to the nadir are the effect of side lobes during the beamforming of the sonar signal.

Also note that features in the nadir region are poorly imaged (white circle in picture b and invisible in picture a)

Guidelines for the interpretation of sidescan sonar images have been published previously (Belderson et al. 1972; Johnson and Helferty 1990). For geomorphological interpretations, particular attention must be paid to the direction of ensonification. Linear structures are generally well imaged along tracks that are parallel to the alignment orientation (i.e. ensonification is perpendicular to the alignments), but may be subdued or invisible on tracks that are perpendicular to the structures (Fig. 5). In addition, features that are close to the nadir (vehicle track) are only poorly imaged. Sidescan sonar survey lines are consequently best planned at a 45° angle to elongated structures and at some distance to smaller targets in order to ensure lateral ensonification. Finally, attention must be paid to adjacent sonar images composing a mosaic. Features showing high backscatter intensity on one track (or one channel) may show low backscatter intensity on the adjacent track (channel) due to different directions of ensonification (Fig. 6).

4 Strengths and Weaknesses
Compared to other acoustic systems used for mapping the seafloor such as multibeam bathymetry systems (see Chapter “Multibeam Echosounders”), sidescan sonar systems are relatively cheap and simple to use. Time-consuming calibration procedures are not necessary nor are expensive additional sensors such as high-precision motion and heading sensors, although basic motion information can help in data processing. In addition, sidescan sonar provides high-resolution seafloor images over comparably large swath widths. Finally, sidescan sonar allows imaging very small-scale relief (in particular at high grazing angles) and provides important indications for the nature and composition of the seafloor. Among the drawbacks of sidescan sonar systems is the fact that the vast majority is used on towed or autonomous underwater vehicles resulting in difficulties to provide accurate navigational data. Some users find it difficult to interpret backscatter data that are generally uncalibrated and frequently show alternating angles of ensonification across the swath (Fig. 6). The latter can be overcome by a survey design using more than 50% overlap between adjoining swaths. This survey design has the advantage of producing two images with different “illumination” but almost doubles survey time. The biggest drawback, however, for many users is the absence of bathymetric information from standard sidescan sonar systems. Interferometric sidescan sonar overcomes this problem and provides a cost-effective tool for quick bathymetric and seafloor backscatter imagery surveys of the seafloor, as these systems are still cheaper than multibeam systems and cover wider swaths. Survey parameters such as towing altitude and choice of pulse length are well-tuned for either bathymetry or seafloor backscatter imagery.
5 Future Developments
Sidescan sonar systems are still widely used in mine detection, submarine pipeline inspection and marine archaeology. It is easy to predict that current developments such as synthetic aperture sonar and parametric synthetic aperture sonar will become more widely available even though these systems are significantly more expensive than traditional systems and require improvement in the navigation accuracy of the towfish and/or AUV. In terms of frequencies used for sidescan sonar, the end of the range appears to be reached. Physics effectively limits the use of even higher frequencies, because attenuation becomes too strong and in consequence the range becomes too small. Additional progress will likely come from improvements in signal processing and a better use of multi-frequency sonar capabilities. The use of colour to represent the different sonar frequencies allows representing more of the information content of the data and appears to be promising (Tamsett et al. 2016). At present, this is limited to multi-frequency instruments, but in the future it might be possible to use the chirp signal for such an
22 I. Klaucke


approach. Another field that is likely to develop in the future is the use of multi-platform sonars that are installed on an entire swarm of AUVs that communicate with each other. In this way, specific targets on the seafloor are illuminated from several different grazing angles and even different frequencies, which may significantly improve our capacities to characterise the seafloor at any given location.

Multibeam Echosounders
John E. Hughes Clarke
Abstract Multibeam echosounders have revolutionized our ability to resolve seabed geomorphology and regionally define its substrate. Using a fan of narrow acoustic beams, the slant ranges, angles and returned backscattered intensity can be employed to define the seabed elevation and infer the substrate. A corridor of data with a width proportional to the projected angular sector is acquired along a vehicle track. Before interpreting the resulting geomorphology, however, it is critical to understand the practical resolution and accuracy limitations that result from a particular system configuration. The spatial resolution of the data depend on a combination of the pulse bandwidth, the projected beam widths and their resulting spacing and stabilization. For a given configuration, the single biggest factor controlling the resulting resolution is the altitude of the platform. For surface mounted systems this results in degrading definition of morphology with depth. As multibeam systems improve, there is the potential to monitor temporal changes in submarine geomorphology. To do so, however, each survey has be positioned to a standard finer than the expected change. The total propagated uncertainty in the location of the resolved topography is a combination of the uncertainty in the position and orientation sensors and their integration as well as the bottom detection algorithm and sound speed field. When interpreting apparent change, it is critical to comprehend the realistic achievable accuracies.

almost four decades. The first operational system was developed for the US Navy in 1964 (Glenn 1970) and by 1977 the first declassified version was available for scientific submarine geomorphological studies (Farr 1980). Since that time, the academic fleets have progressively adopted hull mounted multibeam systems as a standard tool and their use has revolutionized our understanding of seafloor processes. All these early systems were developed for deeper water using frequencies ranging from 12–30 kHz. The first really shallow water multibeam (5001000 kHz), was developed in 1984 for offshore oil and gas infrastructure support (Hammerstad et al. 1985). Since that time these shorter range systems have increasingly been adopted to define coastal and shelf submarine geomorphology (Hughes Clarke et al. 1996). The original driving force behind the development of multibeam sonar arose from military requirements to navigate submarines and ballistic missiles over ocean basins using inertial sensors. Bathymetric terrain matching allowed submarines to update their position without surfacing. Deflections of the gravity vector due to large scale seabed relief such as seamounts were a significant source of error for inertial navigation. The technology was rapidly adopted to support the laying of both military and commercial deep sea cables. As an incidental byproduct of the surveying, it became apparent that there was much to be learnt about seabed morphology at lengths scales above a few hundred metres. This length scale reflected the resolvable topography at those depths and matched the best capable offshore navigational accuracy of the time (transit satellites and single point GPS). The incentive to develop these systems in continental shelf depths was driven by the increasing exploitation of offshore oil and gas fields. At shorter ranges, features could now be resolved down to wavelengths less than 10 m. As such it placed increasing demands on navigational accuracy. Near coastal navigation systems such as Decca and Loran were not adequate, but as Differential GPS was developed this became feasible. Over the past two decades, the parallel improvements in positioning and sonar technology have continued to drive down the positioning uncertainty and minimum resolvable dimensions. This has opened up new applications in submarine geomorphology.
1.2 Current Uses in Submarine Geomorphology
As the early systems were all developed for oceanic depths, the immediate benefit was primarily for deep ocean morphology ranging from mid ocean ridge fabric to continental margin mass wasting. The great advantage over single beam sounding was that the observer could now examine a three dimensional surface rather than interpolate between sparse two dimensional profiles. This allows the discrimination of lineaments in azimuth, something that previously had not been possible without

subjective extrapolation. With a 3D surface, the directional roughness spectrum could now be directly measured (Fox and Hayes 1985). At the same time it became apparent that geomorphic interpretation had to be tempered by knowledge of the limitations inherent in the multibeam systems themselves (de Moustier and Kleinrock 1986). For the first 20 years of use, given the paucity of preceding data, the main aim was to define the current state of the seafloor. Beginning in the early 90’s as survey density increased, interest arose in the ability to resolve seabed change. The first example of this for change detection was Fox et al. (1992). They were able to recognizing the localized expression of 50 m depth changes (in 2000 m of water) due to fresh lava flows. The lateral extent of the flows were several hundred metres, allowing identification even with the poor positioning confidence of the time.
2 Physical/Technical Principles of the Method
2.1 Imaging Geometry
A multibeam sonar consists of a pair of orthogonally mounted linear acoustic arrays. The transmitter (Tx) is usually oriented along the fore-aft axis of the bottom of the vessel whereas the receiver (Rx) is mounted athwartship. The system may be broken into its transmit geometry and reception geometry (Fig. 1). The initial description herein reflects a single sector multibeam. On transmission, a corridor across track is illuminated with a beam that is narrow in the fore-aft direction. Using the receiver, multiple channels are simultaneously formed from beams which are spaced at different across-track steering elevations (Fig. 1c). When the illumination pattern on the seafloor is matched with the reception pattern, a series of small beam footprints are formed. Within each of those footprints, a slant range to the seabed can be estimated and the backscattered intensity at that point can be measured. Using the imaging geometry (azimuth and depression angle of the beam) and correcting for the refracted ray path, a depth at each footprint can be estimated. And if the received intensity is corrected for geometry (ensonified area and range) and radiometry (source level and beam patterns), an estimate of the bottom backscatter strength may be derived (de Moustier 1986) which is strongly correlated with the seabed composition (see also Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”). A bathymetric and bottom backscatter map can thus be collated by combining these data collected along a swath on either side of the ship’s track (Fig. 2). As the swath is defined by an angular sector, the swath width usually grows linearly with depth. Similarly, as the solution density reflects the projection of beams spaced at different angles across the swath, the achievable resolution of the system will also degrade linearly with depth.

2.2 Range Performance
As multibeams are most commonly used from the surface, the required range performance will vary from full ocean to coastal depths. Depending on the depth in the area of interest, the sonar frequency choice needs to be optimized. Range performance of a system is based on maintaining sufficient signal to noise ratio (SNR). The range dependent component of this has both a geometric component (spherical spreading) which is frequency independent and a path length attenuation component which is strongly frequency dependent (Francois and Garrison 1982). As a result lower frequencies, which have lower attenuation coefficients, are utilized in deeper water. The total achievable range is dependent on the source level, the frequency dependent attenuation coefficient, the scattering properties of the seafloor, the length of the pulse utilized and the background noise levels. Most sonars operate at their maximum source level and thus the only operator-controlled variable is the pulse length. As the pulse length controls the ensonified area (colour bands in Fig. 1 lower left), as a sonar system goes deeper, the pulse length is usually increased to maximize the signal to noise. The net result of all these factors is that a performance envelope plot (Fig. 3) can be generated that predicts the useable depth and swath width coverage that can be achieved for a given sonar frequency. Note that the swath width initially grows linearly with depth until the outer most beam bottom detections drop below the usable SNR. Beyond that depth, the advertised maximum angular sector of the sonar can no longer be obtained and the total swath width in metres generally slowly shrinks with depth. Those bottom detections close to the SNR limit will exhibit higher range uncertainty. Given a specific sonar configuration, the environmental factors that affect range performance are noise conditions and seafloor geology. Plots like Fig. 3 usually provide a family of curves depending on seabed type (gravel, sand, mud) and assume a specific noise level. While there are environmental factors that control noise in the ocean, one of the largest factors is vessel self-generated noise. One particular factor is flow noise and engine/propeller noise. Both of these usually increase with speed. The net result is, to achieve the intended swath width, the vessel can rarely steam at its full transit speed. Slowing down provides notably improved data quality. The geomorphologist should thus temper their desire to increase coverage by using higher speeds. An ideal choice of multibeam is one in which the SNR threshold has not been reached at the outer edge of the desired swath. At the lowest frequencies commonly used (*12 kHz), this is not limiting until about 2–3000 m depth. If a wide range of depths need to be covered, however, the frequency most suitable for the deeper end of the depth range will not have the best range resolution in shallower depths. We thus have to consider the tradeoff between range performance and range resolution.
Multibeam Echosounders 29


2.3 Range Resolution
The ability to discriminate targets in range (time) is a product of the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse. For a simple continuous wave (CW) pulse in which the carrier frequency is not varied, the effective range resolution corresponds closely to the pulse length. In this case the bandwidth of the pulse is approximately the reciprocal of the time duration of the pulse length. The shortest pulses that most sonars can generate are about 10 wavelengths long (equivalent to having a bandwidth of 1/10 of the centre frequency). Thus low frequency sonars usually have poorer range resolution. For example a deep water 12 kHz sonar typically has a best range resolution of 1–2 m. For this reason, as a survey moves into shallow water, and the range performance is no longer needed, higher frequency sonars are preferred. Since *2005 frequency modulated (FM) pulses have been introduced that maintain high bandwidth even with longer pulses. This has meant that the higher frequency systems can now be used in deeper water (see 100 kHz FM example in Fig. 3). As a result even higher frequency coastal sonars (200–400 kHz) are now being used on the shelf and 30 kHz systems are being used to full ocean depth.

As Fig. 3 indicates, there is a natural progression from the continental shelf to the full ocean depths of switching between multibeams of progressively lower centre frequencies as the tradeoff between range resolution and range performance is optimized. The next system component to consider is the angular resolution.
2.4 Angular Resolution
The angular resolution is a combination of the achievable beam width and the potential to discriminate angles within a single beam. The width of an unsteered sonar beam is approximately inversely proportional to the number of wavelength along the length of the linear arrays. For example a 1° beam (with reasonable sidelobe suppression) requires about 60–70 wavelengths. Thus a typical deep water 1° 12 kHz multibeam has a transmitter that is about 8 m long. A 30 kHz system requires about 3.5 m and a 100 kHz system needs only 1 m. Larger arrays are both more expensive and require more available space on the bottom of the hull. Thus many multibeam systems come in a choice of array sizes depending on the surveyors need for angular resolution. Figure 4 illustrates the effect of varying beam width on the definition of a seabed target (in this case an object that subtends *0.75° at that depth).

In each pass the utilized length of the transmitter and receiver arrays is altered to illustrate the effect of projected along and across track beam width on the target definition

The simple relationship described above only applies to an unsteered beam. As the beam is steered its width grows inversely with the cosine of the steering angle. Thus, for example, beams steered at 60° are twice as wide. As most multibeam receivers are mounted horizontally that means that the beam width fattens away from nadir. Combined with the fact that the slant range to the seafloor is greater at oblique angles, and the beam subtends an oblique angle on the seabed, it can be appreciated that the across-track beam footprint (Figs. 1 and 5) grows rapidly toward the edge of the swath.
2.5 Bottom Detection
Given a specific range resolution and angular resolution, the multibeam needs to estimate the slant range within each projected beam footprint. A variety of methods are employed depending on the grazing angle of the beam. Beams that are oriented close to normal incidence generally employ an amplitude detection method based on finding the centre of the echo envelope (indicated in Fig. 5). This results in an estimate of an average depth over an area the size of the whole beam footprint (defined by the projected across and along track beam widths, Fig. 1b). At lower grazing angles, the projected beam footprint rapidly becomes very large resulting in poor amplitude detection results. In this case split-aperture

methods based on differential phase are preferred (Pohner and Lunde 1990). These provide an estimate of the depth over an area that now has an effective across track dimension much narrower than the physical across track beam size (Fig. 5). This is because it is based on the ability to discern the point of zero phase crossing (Fig. 5) rather than the actual duration of the echo envelope. In this way, across track morphologic resolution can be maintained. A detailed review of bottom detection algorithms is provided in de Moustier (1993).
2.6 Sounding Density
To describe a certain minimum spatial wavelength on the seafloor, depth solutions have to be at least spaced at less than half that dimension (the Nyquist criteria). Additionally the effective projected beam footprint should not exceed that same half wavelength criteria in order that relief at that scale not be filtered out. Even if these conditions are met, however, as each beam range solution has uncertainty, the minimum amplitude of that desired seafloor roughness will be overprinted by the pseudo random bottom detection noise. To alleviate this it helps to overlap the individual bottom detection footprints to get multiple redundant observations. Under these conditions, spatial averaging of the solutions by gridding will suppress the uncorrelated sounding noise but preserve the resolvable relief, thereby providing a better view of the short wavelength seabed morphology. The amount of overlap between beam footprints depends on the along and across track beam spacing. The across track spacing is generally controlled by the desired swath sector. As the multibeam has a finite number of beam forming channels, the wider the requested sector, the less the noise suppression. In addition to the speed of the vessel, the along track spacing depends on the acoustic travel time to the outermost beams and back. Thus again the wider the swath angular sector the less the noise suppression. Thus by bringing in the angular sector, both the across and along track beam overlap can be increased. This will markedly improve the definition of the seabed targets. Figure 6 illustrates a pair of small volcanic edifices which are imaged by the same sonar varying both the incidence angle and the swath sector. As can be seen, by selecting narrow sectors, the definition of the relief on the edifice improves.
3 Integrated Sensors
The sonar system can only provide range and angle discrimination within a coordinate system oriented relative to the two arrays. That is only of value when integrated with the 3D position of the sonar, its orientation and any subsequent modification of the beam vector in the heterogeneous ocean medium.
Multibeam Echosounders 33


The detailed calculations to perform this integration are beyond the scope of this chapter. The curious geomorphologist should, however, be aware of the steps involved as imperfections in these steps will impact the resulting topographic surface producing both static biases as well as periodic undulations. These false deviations will degrade the morphology thereby obscuring the real relief. Additionally, if repetitive surveying is the aim, these biases and false oscillations will become embedded in the apparent seabed change map obscuring the signature of real sedimentary processes (Hughes Clarke 2012).
3.1 Vessel Reference Frame
In order to relate ancillary position and orientation measurements to a sonar, all of the position, orientation and sonar sensors needs to be located and oriented within a common vessel reference frame (VRF, Fig. 7a), which is fixed within the vessel and centred on a reference point (RP). Additionally, the relative timing (latency) between sensor outputs must be established. Errors in the offset vectors are most critical in shallow water as they represent a significant percentage of the total range to the seabed. Angular errors are equally important irrespective of depth as the distortion of the resulting beam vector (Fig. 7b) produces a depth error that is a fixed percentage of the slant range.

The same pair of knolls are viewed using each sector width and from a range of incidence angles. A 125 m cube is illustrated for scale (2.5% of depth) and the contours are at 5 m intervals. Note particularly the presence of a secondary peak on the southern knoll

Standardized field calibration procedures [the Patch Test (Godin 1998)] are used to estimate the sensor to sensor angular misalignments and time latency. Failure to constrain these errors will result in biases in the geomorphology and impact estimates of seabed change.
3.2 Orientation
The orientation, measured by the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used in two steps. First, the orientation is required to account for the rotation of the lever arm between positioning source and sonar (Fig. 7a). This is a combination of (1): the instantaneous orientation of the IMU at transmit time and receive time and (2): the mount angle of the IMU with respect to the VRF. Once the sonar location is known, the next step requiring orientation is to calculate the beam vector from the sonar in both azimuth and depression angle relative to the local level (Fig. 7b). This is a combination of all of (1) the instantaneous orientation of the VRF at transmit time and receive time (2) the mounting angles of the Tx and Rx in the VRF and (3) the sonar-relative beam vector.

Multibeam Echosounders 35


Orientation angle accuracy is now feasible within 0.02° (1r). Of greater concern is usually the accuracy with which the IMU, Tx and Rx mount angles in the VRF are known. These can result in systematic biases in the resulting swath. Given the rapid rate of change of orientation, any time latency in the motion output relative to the sonar clock will result in periodic distortions of the resulting swath (“wobbles”, Hughes Clarke 2003). Both the static biases and the periodic errors will distort the morphology and overprint the apparent seabed change.
3.3 Horizontal Positioning
With the arrival of the GPS constellation, and now other satellite constellations (e.g.: GLONASS), surface platform positioning confidence at the antenna location can range from a few metres (Differential GPS) to a few decimeters (Precise Point Positioning) to a few centimetres (Kinematic GPS). Legacy multibeam data acquired prior to 1990 may have used transit satellite positioning with a horizontal uncertainty in the 200+ m range. Data acquired using single point GPS prior to 2004 would have been degraded by Selective Availability which limits the positioning to *50 m. Given the size of a beam footprint in the deep ocean, such errors can be tolerated when examining morphology at those depths. For continental shelf surveys, however, which only really started in the 1990s, little useful data would have been acquired that was not at least Differential GPS and thus positioning within 2 m could be reliably achieved. For more recent precise inshore multibeam surveys, in which the beam footprint is less than a metre, correspondingly higher antenna positioning accuracy would be required. To take full advantage of that level of accuracy, the VRF and its instantaneous orientation are essential to determine the unique trajectories of the sonar sensors (Fig. 8a).
3.4 Vertical Positioning
The sonar-relative depth provided by the multibeam has the vertical trajectory of the sonar embedded into it (Fig. 8b). In order to assign a meaningful depth, a vertical datum needs to be defined against which that sonar-relative elevation is referenced. Common options include mean sea level (MSL), the Geoid, Chart Datum, and the Ellipsoid. The first three are water level based and thus will be described together. The fourth datum is hard to practically realize but, as will be explained has significant advantages in reproducibility. To reduce to the chosen datum requires a measure of the instantaneous relative offset of the sonar. That offset can be broken down into different motion periods. At the highest frequencies, the sonar is moving up and down with motions around the
36 J.E. Hughes Clarke


ocean wave spectrum. This can be captured using accelerometer-based heave sensing. Care must be taken to account for additional high frequency motion due to lever arm effects between the point at which the heave is reported (usually the RP) and the sonar (the induced heave). For all the water level datums, once the short period motion is removed, the offset between the RP and the wave free water surface (the RP draught) needs to be estimated (CRS: Fig. 8b). This has both static and dynamic effects resulting from vessel loading and speed through the water. The remaining step is to measure the height of the wave free surface relative to the datum. This long period signal is dominated by tidal frequencies. As the amplitude and phase of the tide varies spatially this can be the single largest source of error for water level based vertical referencing. An alternate to water level based referencing is to use the coordinate system that GPS is inherently measured in. The horizontal positioning is already WGS84 referenced, but an antenna height relative to that ellipsoid is also available (ERS: Fig. 8b). The offset between the geoid or mean sea-level from the ellipsoid varies, however by over a 100 m globally. Thus that offset needs to be measured separately (if required). If, however, the aim of the survey is seabed change, then if both surveys are ellipsoid referenced, they can be compared directly and all the imperfections in heave, draught and tide measurement are avoided completely.

Multibeam Echosounders 37


3.5 Sound Speed
The final step in the integration is to account for the refracted ray path of the beam vector through the heterogeneous sound speed structure in the ocean (Fig. 7c). The sound speed is controlled by the temperature and salinity structure which varies due to oceanographic forcing. To correct for refraction, a vertical profile of the sound speed must be obtained which usually involves stopping the vessel. The challenge facing the surveyor is to decide how frequent that should be as it represents time lost toward expanding the coverage. To address this, the operator should be cognisant of the likely spatial and temporal variability in the local oceanography. The application of sound speed involves two steps. Firstly, the array-relative beam steering requires knowledge of the speed of sound at the transducer face. Ideally there is a probe permanently mounted beside the transducers to update this continuously. This dictates the sonar relative beam vectors that are used in Sect. 3.2 to arrive at the local-level relative beam vector (Fig. 7b). The second step involves accounting for the refracted path as that ray vector leaves (and returns to) the transducer through a medium in which sound speed is known to be variable (Fig. 7c). Imperfections in the sound speed reduction result in a depth error that grows non-linearly with across track distance. For the first step, this depth error is time varying as the vessel rolls and thus results in periodic outer swath oscillations (Hughes Clarke 2003). The second step results in a systematic bias with the across track profile either curved upward or downward (commonly referred to as “smiles and frowns”). Both of these effects degrade the resulting geomorphology.
4 State of the Art Tools
Position and orientation sensors have become increasingly reliable and accurate as well as affordable. To meet that improved positioning capability, higher resolutions are always in demand. For the sonar systems, the most common improvement has been narrower beams (culminating in the typical 0.5°–1.0° beam widths seen today), more beam forming channels, and better bottom detection algorithms. Given all of that, the remaining limitations in sonar resolution are mainly dictated by sounding density. Two principal factors limit even and high density sounding solutions: yaw perturbations and speed limitations. Both these can be solved if the older single transmit sector is broken down into multiple sub-sectors across track which can be independently steered (Fig. 9 left). This allows active yaw stabilization which ensures that yaw perturbations of the vessel no longer result in gaps in seafloor coverage. As an extension of this concept if those sectors are duplicated fore-aft (dual swath), one can generate more than one across track profile in a single ping cycle allowing doubling of the along track data density with resulting improved resolution (Fig. 9).
38 J.E. Hughes Clarke


State of the art multibeam echosounders nowadays also feature the “water column imaging” technique which adds the ability to detect features in the water column, such as bubble streams. While this is a direct indicator of seafloor processes, it is not strictly submarine geomorphology, and thus is not included in this chapter.
5 Strength and Weaknesses of the Method for Investigating Submarine Geomorphology
All the aspects explained above should aid the geomorphologist in predicting the minimum resolvable dimensions and with what confidence they can be positioned. This will impact the design of the multibeam survey which is always a compromise between desired resolution and areal extent. Thus the first thing to decide upon is the intent behind the survey. Specifically what is the smallest dimension of feature that needs to be resolved to address the geomorphic analysis, and what (if any) scale of change are you expecting? Modern surface-mounted multibeam systems permit resolution down to a minimum horizontal wavelength of *2% of altitude. Each step higher in resolution requires bringing the sonar closer to the seabed. If the required altitude is less than
Fig. 9 Resolution and coverage benefits of dual swath. Three passes are compared over the same seafloor with *25 cm high, 8 m long dunes (circled) developed on the back of larger dunes in 170 m of water. With single swath, the features are lost using a standard ±65° sector. To see them either requires pulling in the swath to less than half the width, or adding the second swath

the depth, then submerged vehicles have to be utilized. A submerged vehicle does not enjoy the advantages of continuous satellite position updates. The relative impact of additional position uncertainty due to submergence will be discussed in Chapter “ROVs and AUVs”. In short, the gain in resolution has to be balanced against the potential loss in accuracy. Assuming the only option is a surface vessel, there are tradeoffs that can be made in order to balance coverage and resolution/accuracy. Given the slow and fixed speed of a survey vessel, the rate of areal coverage is mainly dependent on the angular sector employed. A wider sector allows greater coverage but there are a number of compromises in achieved resolution and accuracy. For a given angular sector, the projected beam grows nonlinearly with obliquity which results in both larger footprints and associated higher bottom detection noise. Similarly, integration errors generally grow with increased obliquity. And with wider sectors, the across track beam spacing is wider and the along track beam spacing is sparser both of which result in less footprint to footprint overlap. All of these conspire to decrease the noise suppression and hence the effective resolution. If the intent of the survey is to monitor changes in the resolved morphology through successive surveys, then accuracy will be critical. As discussed (in Sect. 3.3), the total propagated uncertainty reflects the choice of positioning and orientation sensors, their integration, the bottom detection and the refracted ray imperfections. For accuracy, it is primarily the systematic biases due to poor lever arms, imperfect mount angles, tidal errors and incorrect water column that dominate the accuracy. Again many of these contributions compound toward the edges of the swath. In summary, while it may be attractive to cover more ground with a wider angular sector, the quality of the data, both in resolution and accuracy can be compromised. Narrower angular sectors provide both better along and across track data density as well as higher accuracy in bottom detection registration.
6 Conclusions
Multibeam echosounders are one of the most effective ways of resolving and locating seabed geomorphology. A submarine geomorphologist would ideally like both sufficient resolution to identify the signature of active land forming processes, as well as sufficient areal extent to understand the lateral variability in that signature. For a given sonar configuration, however, the resolution is predominantly a function of projected range which, for a surface mounted system, decays with depth. At the same time though, for a fixed angular sector, areal coverage can grow with depth. This benefit should be weighed against the option of constraining the angular sector to help maintain higher sounding density. Proper interpretation of the resulting resolved morphology relies on understanding how these factors can impact the achieved resolution.
40 J.E. Hughes Clarke


The total achievable accuracy, from which you can start to estimate seabed change, is primarily a product of the integration of sensors comprising horizontal and vertical positioning, orientation and sound speed. The uncertainty in all of these can be minimized through proper calibration of alignments, offsets and latencies, as well as frequent sound speed updates and realistic choice of swath width. Understanding what realistic scale of resolvable change is achievable is critical when interpreting apparent geomorphic change.

Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods
Gareth J. Crutchley and Heidrun Kopp
Abstract Seismic reflection and refraction methods are routinely used to illuminate sub-seafloor geological relationships, thereby providing a means to investigate a wide range of Earth processes that influence submarine geomorphology. Since the birth of seismic methods for exploration of ore bodies and petroleum in the early part of the 20th century, progressive technological advancements have ensured that the seismic method remains a fundamental geophysical tool in both the oil and gas industry and scientific research. For both marine seismic reflection and refraction methods, the primary principles are based around the notion of sending artificially-generated sound waves downward into the Earth and recording the energy that returns to recording instruments (receivers). In the case of seismic reflection, the down-going wavefield reflects off geological boundaries characterized by density and velocity contrasts before being recorded by an array of receivers. In seismic refraction experiments, the notion is to record energy that has been refracted at multiple geological boundaries before, ultimately, being refracted at a critical angle and then returning to receivers on the seafloor. Survey designs for both methods are many and varied, ranging from relatively simple two-dimensional surveys, to multi-azimuth three-dimensional surveys that illuminate the subsurface from different directions. Although the state of the art in seismic methods is continually evolving, this chapter gives some examples of modern and developing trends that are relevant to investigations into submarine geomorphology. Examples include high-resolution 3D seismic imaging, high-frequency sub-bottom profiling, waveform inversion and deep-towed seismic acquisition. The strength of the seismic reflection method lies in its ability to gain insight into structural and stratigraphic relationships beneath the seafloor, as well as in investigating fluid flow processes. The refraction method, on the other hand, is often used as the tool of choice for crustal-scale investigations into deeply-rooted geological processes that

1 History of Seismic Methods
The marine seismic method involves the generation and recording of sound waves that reflect and refract as they interact with geological boundaries beneath the seafloor. The methods can therefore be divided into reflection and refraction seismic methods. A brief history of these methods is given here; a more thorough discussion can be found in Sheriff and Geldart (1995) and references therein. Seismic waves reflected and refracted from geological boundaries were first noticed on recordings of waves produced by earthquakes. The use of controlled-source (i.e. not earthquake source) seismology to explore subsurface geology grew mainly out of commercial endeavors, in particular petroleum exploration. In 1924, the seismic refraction method was used by the company Seismos (founded by the German mine surveyor Ludger Mintrop) to make what is generally believed to be the first seismic hydrocarbon discovery. The Canadian Reginald Fessender was the first to propose the use of seismic reflections for finding ore bodies, in a U.S. patent he submitted in 1914. In 1919, the American geophysicist John Clarence Karcher applied for patents in reflection seismology and later co-founded a geological engineering company that conducted field tests in Oklahoma. In 1925, Karcher and Everette Lee DeGolyer formed a company called Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC) and acquired Fessenden’s patent. A few years later, one of the exploration parties working under GRC used the reflection method to find a geological structure that was drilled in 1928 to produce oil—the first successful application of the method for petroleum production. By 1930, the reflection method had begun to take over from the refraction method as the standard for oil and gas exploration. A major advancement in seismic methods was made in the 1950s, with W. Harry Mayne’s invention of common mid-point (CMP) stacking, which dramatically improved signal to noise ratios in the data. The principle of CMP stacking is introduced later in this chapter. The arrival of digital technology in the 1960s represented a revolution for seismic methods, as seismic data collection, storage and processing were all optimized. Another revolution, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was the advent of three-dimensional (3D) seismic acquisition and processing; until that time, seismic surveys had been designed as two-dimensional (2D) profiles. Today, 3D surveying is the norm in the oil and gas industry, and is also widely adopted for academic research. However, 2D reflection and refraction surveys are still widely carried out for both regional and small-scale geological investigations, particularly in academic research.

2 Physical Principles
2.1 Basic Principles of the Seismic Reflection Method
The general principle of the seismic reflection method is that artificially-generated compressional seismic waves (known as P-waves) travel downward into the Earth, where they reflect off geological boundaries and then travel back to the surface to be recorded. In the marine environment, the seismic waves are usually generated behind a vessel from a controlled seismic source towed just below the sea surface (Fig. 1a). Reflected energy from these waves is recorded by receivers that are towed behind the source in a single cable or multiple cables. The recorded data are referred to as a shot record. By collecting lots of shot records at different locations, a seismic dataset is generated that is then processed to generate seismic images that reveal the nature of subsurface geology, including features like lithological boundaries, unconformities and faults (Fig. 1b). The vertical axes of seismic images are usually given in two-way travel time (s), rather than depth (m), since the reflections are recorded as the time it takes for the waves to travel from the source, down to the reflector, and back up to the receiver array. If the sub-surface seismic velocities can be adequately approximated, it is often appropriate to use these velocities to convert the sections from two-way time to depth, making them more intuitive for geological interpretation. The first strong reflection in a marine seismic survey comes from the seafloor,1 where there is a contrast in the physical properties of the water column above and the seafloor sediment below (Fig. 1b). This physical property contrast is known as an acoustic impedance contrast; each medium has its own acoustic impedance (Z), which is the product of the medium’s inherent P-wave velocity (Vp) and density (q). The greater the acoustic impedance contrast, the more reflective is an interface between two layers. This reflectivity is represented by the reflection coefficient ‘RC’, which is defined at the interface between two layers as the ratio of the difference in the layers’ acoustic impedance to the sum of the layers’ acoustic impedance (Fig. 1c). The seafloor typically creates clear, well-defined seismic reflections due to the pronounced density contrast between water and sediment. Many other reflections (some strong, some weak) are also recorded after the seafloor, due to velocity and density contrasts inherent in sub-seafloor sequences of stratified sediments and underlying bedrock (e.g. Fig. 1b). The depth to which one can ‘see’ seismic reflections beneath the seafloor depends on the penetration of the seismic signal, which is a function of the energy of the source and the physical nature of the geological media through which it travels. For example, layer boundaries with high reflection coefficients, such as a

boundary between soft sediments and hard bedrock (Fig. 1b), will reflect much of the seismic energy and transmit only a small amount to greater depths. The recoverable vertical resolution of reflections in a survey is a function of the frequency of the source. A general rule of thumb is that reflectors spaced vertically more than 1⁄4 of a wavelength apart will be distinguishable (Sheriff and Geldart 1995). Thus, higher frequencies, which result in shorter wavelengths for a given seismic velocity (i.e. v 1⁄4 f k), result in higher vertical seismic resolution. The seismic image in Fig. 1b has a dominant frequency of *40 Hz, which means that

just beneath the seafloor, where seismic velocities are approximately 1500 ms−1 or slightly higher, the maximum vertical resolution is *10 m. Higher-frequency sources such as Boomer systems that operate at *1 kHz can deliver vertical resolutions of less than 1 m (e.g. Müller et al. 2002).
2.2 Basic Principles of the Seismic Refraction Method
In contrast to the reflection seismic approach, refraction studies in academia are most commonly used to investigate large scale layering of the lithosphere’s crust and mantle. Subsequent to data acquisition and processing, refraction studies involve forward and/or inverse data modeling to gain information on layer thickness and velocity. The same basic physical principles of the seismic reflection method also apply to the seismic refraction method, where artificially-generated seismic waves propagate into the Earth and spread out as hemispherical wave fronts (Fig. 2a). The concept of a ray path, which trends perpendicular to the wave front, is used to describe the subsurface propagation of a wave. The wave returns to the surface by refraction at subsurface interfaces, which are characterized by an acoustic impedance contrast. The seismic signal is recorded by receivers that are placed on the seafloor at distances from the source that may reach ten times the depth of seismic energy penetration, which depending on the source and physical properties and heterogeneity of the subsurface, may be up to 30–40 km. Each receiver collects a record section of all shots fired along the profile. The horizontal axes of record sections usually display the shot’s offset from the receiver, resulting in negative and positive offsets around the central zero offset where the receiver is located. The vertical axes are usually given in reduced time, i.e. travel time minus distance divided by a pre-selected velocity value (e.g. 8000 ms−1), resulting in a data display where refraction arrivals with a P-wave velocity corresponding to the pre-selected velocity value will be horizontal in the travel-time diagram. When seismic waves encounter a positive impedance contrast at a lithological contact between two rock types, the incident ray will be reflected (see Sect. 2.1) as well as transmitted into the lower medium. A transmitted wave through the lower medium is termed a diving wave. The angle of transmission (t) is related to the angle of incidence (i) through the compressional velocity ratio between the upper and lower medium (i.e. v1/v2) following Snell’s law (Fig. 2a—inset). When the angle of incidence reaches the critical angle ic, the angle of transmission is 90. The critical angle is defined by the inverse sine of v1/v2. The critically refracted wave then travels along the velocity interface at the velocity of the lower medium (i.e. v2) and is continually refracting energy back into the upper medium at an exit angle equal to ic. The resulting wave front is called a head wave, which provides constraints on the velocity boundary depth, like the Moho depth for example. It should be noted that an increase of seismic velocity with depth is a pre-requisite for a critically refracted wave. A velocity inversion will not generate a critical refraction

and hence information from this ‘hidden’ layer is not recorded as the refracted rays are bent towards the normal (e.g. Banerjee and Gupta 1975). In marine refraction studies, shots from a controlled seismic source are generated at equidistant intervals, which are commonly larger than shot intervals in reflection studies on account of the longer ray paths required for refracted arrivals. Hence, data acquisition for reflection and refraction seismic studies usually cannot be conducted simultaneously, but must be performed independently (Kopp et al. 2002). Due to the wide-angle geometry of refracted waves, acoustic wave generation by a controlled source should be extended to offsets beyond the seafloor

The vertical resolution of seismic refraction studies is about 10–20% of the depth, while the lateral resolution is about half the receiver spacing on the seafloor. An example velocity model derived from a seismic refraction survey is given in Fig. 2b.
3 Survey Design and Processing
3.1 Seismic Reflection Surveys
3.1.1 Types of Marine Seismic Reflection Surveys
Marine seismic reflection surveys can be designed to produce 2D seismic sections (like the section in Fig. 1b) or 3D seismic volumes. For 3D data, the recent advent of multi-azimuth and wide-azimuth surveys has improved subsurface imaging in challenging geological environments, like beneath salt structures (Michell et al. 2006). 3D surveys that are repeated over time are known as 4D surveys, since they incorporate the extra dimension of time. Such surveys are used, for example, to monitor the progress of a reservoir during production (Fayemendy et al. 2012), or the sequestration of CO2 into the subsurface (Chadwick et al. 2009). In this section, we provide a brief summary of fundamentals of acquisition and processing of seismic reflection data.
3.1.2 The Seismic Source
By far the most commonly used marine seismic source is the airgun, which, in essence, is a chamber of compressed air that is rapidly released into the water column as a bubble to generate an acoustic pulse (Parkes and Hatton 1986). A common type of airgun used in academic seismic reflection surveys is the GI Airgun, or Mini GI Airgun, where ‘GI’ stands for generator–injector. The principle is that the gun first fires compressed air from the primary chamber (generator) to produce the primary pulse, and then moments later fires from a secondary chamber (injector) to inject a pulse of air into the bubble near its maximum expansion. This second pulse dampens undesirable secondary energy produced during expansion and collapse of the bubble. A range of other marine seismic sources exist, including implosive sources such as water guns and Boomer systems, and sparker systems that generate a source upon discharge of a large capacitor between two electrodes. Boomers and sparkers, for example, are commonly used for very high-resolution imaging of shallow sub-seafloor targets. Marine vibrator-type sources are currently being developed in order to minimize the impact of seismic surveying on marine mammals (Pramik 2013). These sources, however, are still in a prototype phase.
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 49


3.1.3 Receiver Arrays
The receivers used to record the reflected energy in marine seismic experiments are called hydrophones, which are towed behind a vessel in cables called streamers. The hydrophones detect and measure pressure fluctuations in the water caused by the reflected sound waves. In a 2D survey, a single streamer is towed behind the vessel (Fig. 1a). For oil and gas exploration, streamers are often as long as *10 km to provide a large range of source-receiver offsets that are useful for multiple attenuation and seismic inversion—processes routinely carried out when exploring for oil and gas. Academic surveys often use much shorter streamers. Receiver arrays used for 3D surveys are based on the principle of towing multiple streamers parallel to each other. In this way, multiple, closely-spaced subsurface lines can be acquired by a single sail line. 3D receiver arrays take on many different shapes and sizes, ranging from those designed to cover relatively small areas at high-resolution (e.g. array widths of *100 m—Petersen et al. 2010) to large industry projects2 where arrays can be more than 1 km across.
3.1.4 Recording Parameters
The amount and resolution of data recorded for both 2D and 3D seismic surveys depends on a range of recording parameters. These include the spacing between successive shots, the recording duration for each shot, and the sample rate during recording—i.e. how often a sample of the wavefield is recorded (e.g. every 2 ms). High-resolution surveys typically have relatively close spacing between shots, high sampling rates and short record lengths, while lower-resolution, deep-penetration surveys have sparser shot spacing and longer record lengths. Along with the selection of a source type and receiver array, these parameters need to be carefully considered during the design phase of a survey to ensure that the subsurface targets will be adequately imaged.
3.1.5 Basic Processing Steps
Seismic processing methodologies can be highly-specialized and variable, depending on the desired output product from the data. Methods are also constantly evolving to improve imaging and inversion for physical properties. Here, we give a succinct summary of some fundamental steps involved in conventional
2In 2013, the geoscience company CGG released a press statement claiming the largest man-made moving object on Earth—a 3D receiver array with an acquisition footprint of 13.44 km2. This was achieved by towing eight 12 km-long streamers in parallel, with 160 m spacing between the streamers.

image-based processing. Readers seeking more information on processing techniques are directed toward Yilmaz (2001) and Robertsson et al. (2015). Deconvolution and filtering are early stage processes that are used to improve the temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of seismic data. These processes are usually applied to the raw field data of each shot in the survey. Geometry processing and CMP stacking involves defining all locations of shots and receivers in a survey, and assigning common midpoints (CMPs) between shot-receiver pairs. CMPs are geographic locations in the subsurface that will have been sampled numerous times by different shot-receiver pairs (Fig. 3). The shot-domain data (as collected in the field) can then be re-sorted into CMP gathers that have samples of the reflected seismic wavefield from different shots and receivers that originate from approximately the same geographic location. Using an understanding of sub-surface velocities, traces within a CMP gather are then stacked together to create just one representative vertical trace for a given location. Many CMP traces plotted next to each other produce a stacked seismic section. Seismic migration, typically the last major stage in a conventional reflection processing workflow, is the process of moving dipping reflections to their true sub-surface locations and collapsing diffractions (Yilmaz 2001). The result is a sub-surface image like that shown in Fig. 1b. In modern seismic processing, migration routines are commonly carried out prior to stacking, either in the time domain, or, in the case of pronounced lateral velocity variations, in the depth domain. The image in Fig. 1b was generated by pre-stack time migration.
3.2 Seismic Refraction Surveys
3.2.1 Acquisition Geometries
Analogous to seismic reflection surveys, marine refraction studies may be conducted in a 2D or 3D geometry using receivers placed on the seafloor. 4D surveys are repeated recordings to monitor subsurface changes in space and time. 2D surveys are commonly laid out normal to the geological structure of interest, whereas 3D studies result in a data cube or volume (e.g. Westbrook et al. 2008). This geometry is also used in multi-azimuth surveys, where the azimuth is the angle between the shot line and the direction to a given receiver on the seafloor. Multi- to full-azimuth acquisition layouts hence ‘illuminate’ the subsurface target from different angles. The subsurface geology, including the geometry of lithological boundaries, is not directly obvious from the record sections of the individual receivers and is only evident after ray-tracing to iteratively account for all travel time arrivals and velocities.
3.2.2 Receiver Types
Conventional refraction surveys use four-component ocean bottom seismometers (4C OBS), combining one vertical and two horizontal geophones that are oriented orthogonal to each other and a pressure sensor (hydrophone) (Fig. 4). In addition to
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 51


compressional P-waves, four-component receivers also record shear waves (S-waves), which present a significant motivation for recording data on the seabed. Ocean bottom hydrophones (OBH) only carry a pressure sensor. Both receiver types are usually deployed in a free-fall mode from a vessel. They carry a release unit to clear the anchor upon receiving an acoustic release signal. A flotation brings the instrument back up to the surface, where it will be recovered. Where higher

For each shot, reflected energy is recorded in the four hydrophones (cyan dots). CMPs are the numbered green dots on the seafloor. The broken yellow line highlights CMP 4, which is sampled by each of the four shots over a range of source-receiver offsets (i.e. the blue lines showing ray paths.)
52 G.J. Crutchley and H. Kopp


precision deployment locations are required, e.g. in areas with dense offshore infrastructure, autonomous ocean bottom nodes (OBN) are deployed and subsequently recovered with the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROV). Ocean bottom cables (OBC) contain numerous four-component sensors and are laid on the seafloor by a cable vessel. Alternatively, an OBC may be permanently deployed or buried in the ocean bottom to monitor temporal changes—a method known as life of field seismic acquisition.
3.2.3 Basic Processing Scheme
Standard processing of OBS data includes clock drift correction if differences between the long-term stabilization of the internal clock and the sample frequency clock occur. Additionally, within a given sample period, fewer or more samples than required can be recorded, e.g. 99 samples instead of 100, which needs to be corrected.
Fig. 4 Ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) designed by GEOMAR, Germany. During deployment to the seafloor the entire system rests horizontally on the anchor frame. The instrument is attached to the anchor with a release transponder. Communication with the instrument over ranges of 4–5 nautical miles (*8–9 km) for release and range is possible through a transducer hydrophone. After releasing its anchor weight of approximately 60 kg, the instrument turns 90° into the vertical and ascends to the surface with the floatation on top
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 53


Drifting of the OBS in the water column during deployment may cause instrument positions to be mislocated by up to several hundred meters, leading to data asymmetry and incorrect travel time information in the record section. Instrument re-location is carried out using the water wave arrival and exact shot geometry. Subsequently, a standard signal processing scheme will include a time-gated deconvolution to remove predictable bubble reverberations and obtain a clean signal without disturbing interference of multiple and primary phases. A deconvolution will improve the temporal resolution of the seismic data by compressing the basic seismic wavelet. The recorded wavelet has many components, including the source signature, recording filter, and hydrophone/geophone response. Ideally, the deconvolution should compress the wavelet components to leave only the subsurface reflectivity in the seismic trace. As the amplitude spectra of seismic traces vary with time and offset, the deconvolution must be able to follow these variations and hence is time-gated. In a further step, a time and offsetvariant frequency filter accounts for frequency changes caused by signal attenuation. The filter’s passband continuously shifts towards lower frequencies as offset and record time increase.
3.2.4 Forward and Inverse Modeling
Modeling of seismic refraction data includes the identification and picking of the various phases recorded. The data picks then are used as input to forward and inverse modeling approaches. Often, both approaches are used alternately to supplement each other. The idea of forward modeling is to solve the equation of motion for seismic waves. Rays travel through the geological model and the corresponding synthetic travel times are compared with the recorded seismic data. If the fit is within an acceptable level of accuracy, the model is a reasonable representation of the subsurface. If the travel time misfit is too large, the model is altered and new synthetic travel times are computed. This process continues iteratively until the misfit between calculated and real travel times matches the requirements. In contrast, the inverse approach calculates the velocity-depth model from the acquired travel-time data, based on the linearized relationship between the travel time data and the velocity structure Gm = d, where ‘m’ is the unknown slowness vector (model), ‘d’ is the travel time vector (data) and ‘G’ is a matrix whose rows contain path lengths through each model element (grid) for a given ray path. Commonly the forward model provides the input model to the inversion. The determined model differences between forward and inverted velocity models are updated and refined in the forward model. The updated forward model then provides a new input model to the inverse step. The advantage of this procedure is the full control and stepwise adjustment of the model structures, which are built in the forward model.

4 State of the Art Tools and Methods
4.1 Overview
Seismic methods are continually evolving, often with much of the impetus coming from the oil and gas industry investing in new technologies to find oil and gas. In this section, we give a brief overview of a selection of state of the art tools and techniques that are applicable to submarine geomorphological investigations. What we present is just a selection of many important areas of reflection and refraction seismic methods, which are providing better illumination of challenging targets and allowing more constrained velocity models to be generated from seismic data.
4.2 Parametric Single-Beam Echo-Sounding
Acoustic imaging at the high end of vertical resolution is valuable for understanding fine detail of the most geologically recent processes that have influenced submarine geomorphology. Parametric single-beam echo-sounders are ship-mounted instruments that generate two, slightly different, high frequency signals (e.g. 36–39 kHz and 41–44 kHz, for the Kongsberg TOPAS PS40 system). The interference of these two high frequency signals in the water column results in a lower frequency signal (e.g. 2–8 kHz for the TOPAS PS40 system) with a narrow beam width that produces very high resolution images of the shallow sub-surface (e.g. more than 75 m penetration at a vertical resolution of *15 cm in ideal cases—Vardy et al. 2012). Modern systems like this can produce very detailed images of sub-surface stratigraphy, structure and fluid flow processes.
4.3 Deep-Towed Seismic Acquisition
Much higher lateral resolution in marine seismic data can be achieved by towing the hydrophones close to the seafloor, rather than just beneath the sea surface (e.g. Breitzke and Bialas 2003; He et al. 2002; Marsset et al. 2014). Recent advancements in the field of deep-towed seismic acquisition have been driven by the development of a seismic source that is capable of operating effectively and consistently at variable water depths—that is, operating independent of hydrostatic pressure. The French marine research institute IFREMER has used such a deep-towed source with a single-channel receiver (Leon et al. 2009) and more recently with a deep-towed multi-channel streamer (Marsset et al. 2014). A major challenge with this technology is obtaining the very accurate positioning of the source and the hydrophones that is required for optimal imaging. Marsset et al. (2014) used a source with a frequency bandwidth of 220–1050 Hz, together with a
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 55


streamer comprising 52 channels spaced 2 meters apart. In order to be able to accurately predict the shape of the streamer at depth in the water column, each hydrophone was equipped with sensors to monitor changes in pitch, roll and heading during acquisition. Their dataset, acquired in the Western Mediterranean Sea, provided excellent high-resolution imaging of mass transport deposits amid turbidite and hemipelagic sedimentary successions.
4.4 High-Resolution 3D Seismic Imaging
High-resolution 3D images of the sub-seafloor are very powerful for studies of submarine geomorphology because they enable sedimentary and tectonic processes to be unraveled at a high level of detail. Technology that is at the state of the art in this space is the P-Cable seismic system, which was initially developed in Norway in 2001 and patented shortly thereafter (Planke and Berndt 2003). The system is based on multiple (up to 24) relatively short streamers (typically 25–100 m in length) towed close to each other (*10 m apart) behind the vessel. Dense receiver spacing within each of the closely-spaced streamers results in very high spatial resolution. Figure 5 shows an example of P-Cable seismic data from offshore Costa Rica that images paleo-channel systems. The horizontal resolution of these data is *6 m and the dominant frequency is *100 Hz. 3D surveying with even higher resolution systems (e.g. a 1.5–13 kHz chirp transducer array; Gutowski et al. 2008) can deliver vertical and spatial resolutions at the decimeter scale.

4.5 Broadband Imaging
A significant issue inherent in seismic acquisition comes from the free surface ghost —a phenomenon caused by the downward reflection of the upward travelling wavefield at the sea surface due to the fact that both source and receiver are towed beneath the sea surface. The result of the free surface ghost is both constructive and destructive interference of the seismic signal over the natural bandwidth of the source. The nature of the interference depends primarily on the depth of the receivers beneath the sea surface, and can result in major loss of energy at certain (desirable) frequencies. Towing the receiver array (i.e. streamers) at relatively shallow depths will compromise the ability to recover low frequencies, whereas towing at relatively deep depths will compromise high frequencies. In recent years there has been a strong focus on extending the bandwidth of seismic frequencies recovered during acquisition—i.e. efforts have been made to design methods that reduce the ghost effect described above. One such method is the over-under deghosting method, where streamers are deployed as vertically aligned pairs at two different tow depths (Hill et al. 2006; Sonneland et al. 1986). In this method, the tow depths can be set such that the compromised parts of the frequency spectrum in one streamer are compensated for by the other, and vice versa. Combining the frequency spectra from both streamers in the under-over pair results in a broader frequency bandwidth with, in particular, greater recorded amplitudes at low frequencies. Using deeper tow depths than conventional acquisition also decreases the noise due to wave motion. Such deghosting methods can yield dramatic improvements in seismic imaging. For more information on this topic, the reader is referred to Robertsson et al. (2015) and references therein.
4.6 Mirror Imaging of OBS Data
The wavefield recorded by a seafloor receiver is composed of primary reflections, which travel up from the interface to the seafloor (up-going), as well as receiver ghosts or sea surface multiples. The latter represent an additional reflection off the sea surface, which acts as a ‘mirror’ (Fig. 6). The signal then travels back down from the sea surface to the seafloor (down-going). OBS surveys using only primary signals yield notoriously poor illumination for interfaces beneath the seabed that are shallower than the station interval (Grion et al. 2007). Illumination is improved by mirror imaging, where the multiple signals are also used (e.g. Dash et al. 2009). Depending on the water depth, the shot point grid laterally extends far beyond the receiver grid. Hence the mirror signal yields a much broader subsurface illumination than the primary signal. Mirror imaging consequently provides highly improved coverage and imaging of shallow structural elements. The receiver datum for mirror imaging is shifted to a level twice the water depth to account for the additional ray path of the multiple through the water column. The method is applied
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 57


for coarsely spaced seafloor receivers and in studies targeting shallow subsurface structure.
4.7 Joint Inversion of Refraction and Reflection Data
The incorporation of reflection seismic streamer data in the modeling process is beneficial to coincident refraction studies to include a priori structural information on lithological boundaries. Seismic tomography has proven successful to determine the velocity-depth structure in conjunction with subsurface reflectors and faults (e.g. Korenaga et al. 2000). This approach is based on the simultaneous inversion of refracted and reflected phases with floating reflectors. The method employs a hybrid ray tracing scheme combining the graph method with further refinements utilizing ray bending with the conjugate gradient method (the reader is referred to Korenaga et al. 2000 for a more detailed discussion). Smoothing and damping constraints regularize the iterative inversion. The velocity model is defined as an irregular grid hung from the seafloor reflection. From the coincident MCS seismic data, the well resolved upper (sedimentary) portions may be included as a priori structure into the starting model and fixed during the iterations using spatially variable velocity damping. To make use of secondary arrivals and different reflections, a layer stripping approach is utilized and subsequently the velocity model is built from top to bottom (e.g. Planert et al. 2010). This approach further involves the use of spatially variable velocity damping for the upper layers, e.g., when restricting the picks to the lower layers, and the incorporation of velocity jumps into the input models at primary features such as the basement, plate boundary and the crust mantle boundary (Moho).

4.8 3D Full-Waveform Inversion of Wide-Angle, Multi-azimuth Data
Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a method widely used in the petroleum sector, and for academic research, to produce high-resolution velocity models of the sub-surface. Such velocity models can make it possible to identify lithology types and pore fluid compositions that might otherwise not be discernable from seismic reflection imaging alone. Recent studies have highlighted the strength of FWI to produce detailed P-wave velocity models if surveys are acquired to record wide-angle, multi-azimuth refractions (Morgan et al. 2013). By testing recoverable resolutions for synthetic seismic data, Morgan et al. (2013) discuss how such surveys, with an array of ocean bottom receivers, can resolve deep structures in the crust better than any other geophysical technique. Future developments in this area could significantly improve our ability to investigate deep-seated geological processes like arc volcanism, for example, that have distinct submarine geomorphological manifestations.
5 Strengths and Weaknesses
The clear strength of seismic methods in submarine geomorphology is the ability to illuminate the sub-surface over large areas, either by acquiring a number of 2D seismic profiles or by acquiring 3D datasets. Other geophysical tools like multibeam echo-sounders and sidescan sonar systems (Chapters “Sidescan Sonar” and “Multibeam Echosounders”, respectively) efficiently deliver remarkably high-resolution images of the seafloor, but do not image sub-seafloor geology. Thus, seismic reflection and refraction methods are routinely used to investigate the deeper processes that shape the seafloor. In comparing reflection and refraction methods, it is clear that the seismic reflection method is the tool of choice for producing high-resolution images of buried strata and structures. 3D seismic reflection methods, in particular, can deliver imagery that allows us to examine past geomorphological expressions, such as meandering channel systems and mass transport deposits (e.g. Kolla et al. 2007). On the other hand, seismic refraction experiments have their strength in developing large-scale velocity models that are consistently used to explore deep, crustal processes, like subduction, seafloor spreading, and arc volcanism (e.g. Kopp et al. 2011). In terms of low-cost academic surveys, high-resolution 2D seismic reflection profiles are generally simpler to acquire, process and interpret than crustal-scale 2D seismic refraction profiles. The latter require greater source volumes, longer source-receiver offsets, as well as the deployment and recovery of instruments on the seafloor. When compared to other data acquisition methods used in submarine geomorphology, seismic methods are probably best considered as a tool that provides the
Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods 59


‘bigger picture’ context for a given geomorphological investigation. In this sense, they are similar to electric and electromagnetic methods that are also used to remotely sense the sub-surface. The strength of seismic methods is not in delivering detailed seafloor characteristics; that is best investigated with higher-resolution side-scan sonar imaging (Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”) and targeted seabed sampling (Chapter “Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling”). Indeed, direct sampling methods are the only way to confirm lithological interpretations that are made from remotely-sensed data. Seismic methods are most powerful when combined with other geo-scientific methods. For example, the integration of high-resolution seismic data and shallow sediment samples often vastly improves the understanding of submarine slope failure processes that dramatically change seafloor morphology (e.g. Vardy et al. 2012). In another example, the combination of controlled-source electromagnetic data with seismic data can help to identify and characterize sub-seafloor fluid flow processes that also often manifest themselves at the seafloor (Goswami et al. 2015).

Quantitative Analyses of Morphological Data
Philippe Blondel
Abstract Submarine morphologies are complex and analysed based on shapes, dimensions and internal variations. They are also analysed based on their surroundings. This chapter starts by comparing the sensors providing this information: most of them are based on remote sensing (acoustic/electromagnetic). They produce Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), corresponding to regularly sampled (and/or interpolated) grids. Illustrated with regular examples, the chapter shows the basic measurements used to describe and compare morphologic data, their variations with multi-scale approaches (e.g. Fourier space, fractals) and how this can be used to identify trends and patterns. Geographic Information Systems and the emerging applications of Artificial Intelligence and data mining are also presented.
1 Mapping Submarine Morphologies
Geological structures on the seabed or below are analysed based on their shapes, their dimensions and their internal variations. They are also compared to their general surroundings, to provide more context and refine their interpretation. For example, sand ripples are recognised as elongate structures with relatively small heights, occurring in groups of generally similar characteristics and situated in shallow waters susceptible to wave action. Variations in their directions, their relative dimensions and their sedimentary composition might provide additional information on their emplacement and evolution with time. Volcanic edifices will generally present circular or sub-circular shapes, with clear variations in topography associated with dome emplacement and additional cones; individual lava flows will give information about eruption stages, their types and their relative chronologies. But where does this morphologic information come from? The previous chapters have presented a variety of techniques, most of them based on remote sensing: sidescan sonar (Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”), multibeam

echo sounder (Chapter “Multibeam Echosounders”), and seismics (Chapter “Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods”). The following chapters will present direct physical sampling (Chapter “Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling”) and localised surveys with bespoke subsea platforms (Chapter “ROVs and AUVs”), although the former might not always measure morphology directly. Other approaches worthy of mention are the emerging uses of airborne lidar (e.g. Vrbancich, in Blondel 2012), airborne or spaceborne synthetic-aperture radar (e.g. Marghany, also in Blondel 2012), and subsea stereo-photogrammetry (Pouliquen et al. 2002, see also Chapter “ROVs and AUVs”). This multiplicity of tools is highlighted by Lecours et al. (2016), who review the different applications and advocate combining sensors and data sources as much as possible [the related discussion paper by Mitchell (2016) offers helpful comments too]. This chapter will assume a reasonably accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) has been created, with a final resolution commensurate with the processes of interest. This DTM will most likely have been created by acoustic remote sensing. Because of their large swath coverage and increasing resolutions, multibeam echosounders are often and rightly considered the tools of choice to measure morphology (as shown in Chapter “Multibeam Echosounders”). Ideally, their measurements have been processed to international standards, e.g. the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) standards S-44 for hydrographic surveys (https:// www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-44_5E.pdf). Primarily intended for navigation, their accuracy means this standard is still fully relevant to geomorphologists. De facto standards are also recommended for processing multibeam backscatter (Lurton and Lamarche 2015, and references therein), as it provides other information about topography. To a lesser extent, sidescan sonars can provide comparable information, either by design (interferometric sonars), by operation (multi-angle operation) or through additional processing (for example deriving heights and shapes of protruding objects imaged at grazing angles, although this is strongly limited by the grazing angles used, see also Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”). The interactions of acoustic waves with the seabed are complex and presented in multiple textbooks (e.g. Blondel 2009; Lurton 2010). The first contributor to acoustic reflectivity is the slope of the surface being imaged (Fig. 1a). Because of the size of the sonar footprint at this location, the actual depth will vary between the centre of the footprint (average) and its edges (minimum and maximum values). Depending on how acoustic returns are processed, the depth returned to the user might be any value within the full range (ideally the median or the mean). The acoustic reflectivity will be also extremely sensitive to the micro-scale roughness of the seabed, at scales comparable to the imaging wavelength (for a 150 kHz sonar, this would be roughly 1 cm). Because of the wavelengths used to quantify seabed morphologies, this is generally less of an issue. The third and smallest contributor to acoustic reflectivity will in fact become the second largest contributor to depth accuracies: depending on seabed type and imaging frequencies, the sonar waves might travel within the immediate sub-seabed, and acoustic returns might come from deeper than expected. This is seen with dual-frequency systems: Blondel and Pouliquen (2004) show for example how 100-kHz maps show returns from the top

of underwater vegetation, whereas simultaneous 384-kHz measurements show slightly deeper returns from the seabed itself. In extreme cases, e.g. with low-frequency sonars such as GLORIA (6.5 kHz), it is possible to detect structures well below a thick mud cover (Moore et al. 1989). Care should therefore always be taken when using sonar measurements, and it is necessary to check whether the acoustic waves can actually show returns from deeper in the seabed than expected.
2 Quantitative Structures, Shapes and Their Variations
Seabed morphology is inherently complex, both at regional and local scales. Figure 2 shows idealised landforms in a sedimentary environment. Other landforms not represented here would include volcanic constructs (from lava flows to small cones or large domes), large faults and landslides (potentially with different debris slides), hydrothermal areas (with small and large edifices, deposits and small fissures), and any seabed affected by marine life (e.g. vegetation, burrowing) or human activities (from shipwrecks to cables or caissons). Readers interested in how these other structures look like when imaged with sonars are invited to read the “Handbook of Sidescan Sonar” (Blondel 2009), which provides many examples from around the world. The key points here are how these different generic shapes can be detected, quantified and analysed. At a regional scale, the seabed is best characterised by its regular sloping topography, best revealed by comparison of along-slope profiles. Local variations are visible, for example, the canyon in the middle of the sketch (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional

analyses of the shelf edges and slopes would reveal more about the dynamic sedimentary regimes, in particular along-shore transport of sediments. Finer-scale analyses (in 2-D) would reveal the presence of sand ripples in the shallow waters exposed to wave action, and 3-D analyses might show differences in their formation and evolution. Small structures like underwater prolongation of rivers (top left) might also show offsets, indicative of tectonic activity. Larger structures, like the canyon fan (bottom right) would need quantifying in 2-D and 3-D to show variations in sediment supplies and links to the geology (and morphology) of deeper waters. Practically speaking, this means the geomorphologist needs to analyse 2-D profiles and 3-D sections of parts of the DTM. In the case of a submarine canyon (Fig. 3, left), cross-sections taken at regular intervals can reveal canyon evolution and depth variations, steep slopes and potential asymmetry, and variations in sediment deposits in the canyon and on its banks. Repeat surveys can be used to measure steepening of the slopes, or further changes, which might lead to geo-hazards. Figure 3 (top right) shows a portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with high-resolution data near the ridge axis and lower-resolution bathymetry away from the active part of the ridge. Cross-sections (Fig. 3, bottom right) will reveal different processes depending on the scale at which these measurements are made, highlighting the need for high resolution. Lecours et al. (2016) recommend “extending the analysis beyond the basic 3  3 neighbourhood [...] as it facilitates the identification of spatial scales” relevant to specific processes. This multi-scale analysis should be a necessity, and not just a recommendation, as it is the only way to enable meaningful comparisons between datasets measured with different sensors.

3 Geostatistics to Geographical Information Systems
3.1 Basic Measurements
A bathymetric profile across a surface of interest can be expressed as a collection of points, with depths z(i), measured at N points regularly spaced (and denoted with index i, varying from 1 to N). The first parameter of interest will be the average depth hzi:
hzi 1⁄4 1
N
N X
i1⁄41
zðiÞ ð1Þ
If choosing a reference depth z0, the average height <h> will be calculated with reference to the relative depths z(i)−z0, giving rise to a similar equation:
hhi 1⁄4 1
N
N X
i1⁄41
zðiÞ  z0
ð Þ ð2Þ
For a portion of the map, assumed square for simplicity (i.e. N points along one direction and N points along the orthogonal direction), the average depth is then expressed as:

Modified after Gómez Sichi et al. (2005). Right Bathymetry from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (from the R2K database) is compiled with high resolution near the ridge axis and lower resolution data away from the main segments (top). Bathymetric profiles will reveal different information based on their resolution (bottom). Modified after Blondel (2009)

The next equations will follow the same assumption of a square sampling, justified if the original measurements have been processed with square gridding (which is the case in most software now) or interpolated to the same resolution along both axes. Changing to non-square samples is mathematically straightforward, replacing N with M where needed. All subsequent equations can also be adapted simply to profiles along a single direction (using only one summation, for example). The average height or depth does not account for small-scale variations, which can be very important in describing the surface (e.g. for talus deposits or for lava flows). From an acoustic point of view, the roughness will also be indicative of the likely scattering processes (cf. Blondel 2009). The average roughness, also called rms roughness, is traditionally calculated as:
z0 1⁄4

This roughness can be biased if the underlying surface is on a slope, and it is often recommended to measure the rms tilt over a range Dx:

Dx ð5Þ
This tilt can be used to remove the underlying surface from the measurements, if it is regular enough or known well enough. This operation is often known as de-trending, and it requires accurate assessment of what the background surface is like, or should be like, to avoid biasing the final results. Local slopes are also of interest, as they can be used to delineate features. The slope gradient is defined as the maximum rate of elevation change, and it can be calculated over different ranges (in some datasets, using the maximum resolution available can indeed add noise and it is then necessary to apply simple low-pass filters, for example 3  3 moving averages). In its simplest form, the slope gradient is defined as:
gradient 1⁄4 atan @z
@x
 2
þ @z
@y
 2!
ð6Þ
Variations in slope gradients over large areas can be used to distinguish terrains based on their statistical differences, and not on any qualitative interpretations.
68 P. Blondel


Micallef et al. (2012) use, for example, the cumulative frequency distribution of slope gradients to identify points of inflection. This allows the quantitative separation of morphological units such as flat zones, sloping zones, crests, depressions and breaks of slopes. Shaw and Smith (1990) quantify the spatial correlation of these variations with auto-covariance functions to distinguish very different types of heterogeneous terrains. A tool now frequently used by marine geomorphologists (e.g. Verfaillie et al. 2007) is the Bathymetry Position Index (BPI). Implemented in common software like ArcGISTM, the BPI algorithm measures height differences between a focal point and the average calculated over surrounding cells within a user-defined shape (which can therefore be square, but can also be restricted to a specific morphological feature like a canyon or depression). By definition, negative BPIs correspond to local depressions and positive BPIs to crests. The BPI can be used in conjunction with the topographic ruggedness index (TRI), introduced by Riley et al. (1999). The TRI measures the square root of the average of squared height differences between a centre point and the closest measurements (i.e. 8 measurements for a square grid). More complex equations can quantify other parameters of interest, like the profile curvature, which represents the maximum change in slope gradients between adjacent cells in a chosen neighbourhood. It is used for example to identify convex and concave breaks of slope (i.e. faults, fissures and steep escarpments). It is defined by Micallef et al. (2012) by looking at derivatives of the height z over orthogonal directions x and y (over at least 3 consecutive points, but any range can be considered):

Once identified on the maps, for example through image processing or geostatistics, some morpho-geological units can be quantified with other parameters, like their lengths, widths, areas or volumes (if knowing where the base of the unit is likely to be). For submarine canyons and other similar features, it is often interesting to calculate the sinuosity index SI, defined as the ratio of the length along the structure to the straight distance between its extremities (Euclidean distance). In terrestrial geomorphology (e.g. Mueller 1968), these values are traditionally interpreted as “almost straight” (SI < 1.05), “winding” (1.05  SI < 1.25), “twisty” (1.25  SI < 1.50) and “meandering” (SI > 1.50). For closed structures, other parameters of interest will be the overall shape, which can be characterised with tools like the Hough transform or by measures of similarity with expected shapes (circles, ellipses, etc.). More information can be derived from combining different measurements (e.g. principal axes of several structures, lengths, widths, slope histograms), as shown in Shaw and Smith (1987), inter alia.

3.2 Variations with Spatial Scales
If regular enough, i.e. occurring at specific spatial internals (or wavelengths), morphogeological variations show a range of spatial frequencies (not to be confused with the imaging frequency). This is best measured using simple Fourier transforms, whose values are calculated at different spatial frequencies f:
Fð f Þ 1⁄4
Zþ 1
1
zðxÞei 2pf xdx ð8Þ
From a mathematical point of view, the integral sign is used to denote summation over samples as close as possible to each other, and over as large a range as possible (−∞ and +∞). In practice, the use of finite ranges of integration will limit the frequencies measurable. Power spectral densities W(f) are a good way to check which frequencies are predominant:
WðfÞ 1⁄4 1
L ReðFð f ÞÞ2 þ ImðFð f ÞÞ2

ð9Þ
For example, sand ripples with a spacing X will have much higher power in the spatial frequency 1/X. Ripple systems with different heights, different widths and different distances will show in the Fourier spectra with different spatial frequencies (along each direction chosen), and this might be used to highlight overlain ripple fields, or assess how they degrade with currents or wave action. Other types of decompositions, e.g. with wavelet transforms, are available; they will not be presented here, but their use should always keep in mind how much physical reality can be represented with specific mathematical functions. The role of scale is important, as it is conditioned by the data acquisition (resolution of the mapping sensor and small-scale accuracy), by the processing (quality of the interpolation and gridding schemes used) and by the physical processes themselves. The Nyquist theorem states that measurements should cover at least twice the frequency to analyse. A topographic process changing every 2 m would need measuring at least every 1 m to get an accurate representation of its variability. And the number of measurements is commensurate with the parameter to derive. For example, if using a bathymetry dataset with 10-m resolution, calculating the local slope uses 3 points, i.e. distances of 30 m. Mean slopes need to average over 3 values or more, i.e. distances close to 100 m (calculating local slopes every 10 m would bias the measurements, as neighbouring points will include similar bathymetry values). Sometimes, measurements made over particular spatial scales will be very different if done over different scales. This was first formalised by Mandelbrot (1967), who described how the size of complex lengths/surfaces will increase as the
70 P. Blondel


measuring unit decreases. This can be plotted as a logarithmic function, indicative of the fractal dimension D (in this case, the slope of the function equates D − 1). This started the research into fractals, also known as self-affine or fractional Brownian statistics (more detailed information is available at: http://www.math. yale.edu/mandelbrot/). Variations of heights with the horizontal measurement scale L follow power laws and can for example be used to derive a scaling constant CH and a quantity H (known as the Hurst exponent and in the range 0–1):
hhi 1⁄4 CH  L
L0
 H
ð10Þ
CH is the rms height when L = L0, and the fractal dimension is directly related to the Hurst exponent:
D 1⁄4 2  H ðfor a profileÞ D 1⁄4 3  H ðfor a surfaceÞ

ð11Þ
In the case of radar remote sensing of planetary surfaces, these parameters can be used to easily distinguish between lava flows, such as smooth pahoehoe (H = 0.63, CH = 0.05), rough pahoehoe (H = 0.48 and CH = 0.16) and a′a (H = 0.26, CH = 0.24) (Campbell 2011). Fractal dimensions can therefore be considered a measure of roughness, at least in this case. Fractals are very useful to describe scale-independent processes, i.e. processes which will produce the same results at small and large scales. In some cases, the processes are more complex and cannot be described with a single fractal dimension consistent at all scales (multifractals) (e.g. Ijjasz-Vasquez et al. 1992). The mathematics can rapidly become complex and thus will not be treated here. Interested readers can find more in books and articles by Benoit Mandelbrot, who founded this field, and look at applications to seabed morphologies in Mareschal (1989), Malinverno (1989) and Goff et al. (1993).
3.3 Finding Trends and Patterns
There are many other measures than those presented in the previous two sub-sections. All should be related to physically meaningful descriptions of the seabed and of morphological structures. Some metrics, e.g. lengths, widths, directions, can be directly associated to geological processes, for example the evolution of a submarine canyon. Other metrics might be more difficult to interpret, and this is where data can be usefully compared to expected distributions. Simple bathymetric profiles, for example, can be interpreted as the combination of a background profile, associated to the regional slope, systematic deviations, associated to local processes, and random or pseudo-random smaller deviations.
Quantitative Analyses of Morphological Data 71


Auto-regressive (AR) models and auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) derivations can be used to unravel the local and regional contributions (see Box et al. 2015 for examples in a variety of domains). More deterministic approaches have been followed, for example matching existing profiles to spline functions and relating each base function to a specific geological process. Surface analyses have similarly aimed at separating the stochastic part of the seafloor morphology from more local (and/or random) processes. Goff and Jordan (1989) used the covariance of bathymetry to study abyssal hill formation in different regions, taking great care to remove the effects of data acquisition and resolution. Mitchell (1996) designed a technique to automatically fit paraboloid shapes to bathymetry, and used this approach to interpret transport processes at continental slopes (Mitchell and Huthnance 2007). The field of pattern-matching is vast, and these are only two examples, selected because they are perfect demonstrations of how to match theoretical patterns to existing data, within the constraints of how it was acquired, and how to derive meaningful interpretations of geomorphological processes. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combine datasets and measurements in geo-located and inter-comparable databases. They allow direct query of specific characteristics (e.g. “can sediment flow from this canyon affect this area downslope?”, “how far are hydrothermal vents from small-scale fissures?”). Many examples are currently available on the market, and to cite but one, ArcGISTM seems rather prevalent at the moment, with new tools specifically built for the geomorphological community (e.g. Rigol-Sanchez et al. 2015; Kelner et al. 2016). Other techniques, such as multivariate analyses (e.g. Husson et al. 2009), neural networks (e.g. Mallat 2016), or Artificial Intelligence (e.g. Gvishiani and Dubois 2002) aim to extend this guided approach by exploring how subsets of the data might relate to each other. Used in many other data-rich fields, the new discipline of data mining is likely to revolutionise submarine morphometry (e.g. Wan et al. 2010; Planella Gonzalez et al. 2013). One caveat is that market leaders, and any GIS for that matter, should always clearly present the rationale behind the calculations, avoiding a “black box” approach where numbers lose their meaning by not being testable or not matching a physical meaning. This is often why some communities rely on programming languages like Matlab or R (e.g. Husson et al. 2009) to keep this important open-source aspect.
4 Conclusions
Modern sensors can map the seabed at spatial resolutions varying from a kilometre (for the oldest generation) to sub-metre (for most systems available now), with depth accuracies generally below a metre. The resulting datasets are extremely large and they can provide important information on the morphology of the seabed, on the formation and evolution of different structures, and how they are affected with time (for example when doing repeat surveys). It is therefore important to quantify

accurately the different morphologies and to be able to relate them to geologically meaningful processes. This chapter introduced some of the key metrics for morphology, selected on the basis of simplicity and demonstrated applicability to remote sensing (acoustic or electromagnetic). From simple profiles to surfaces and volumes, these measurements aim at quantifying the underlying processes. How accurate they are depends on how good the measurements are, and how well their potential limitations are understood (imaging accuracy, combination of different resolutions, role of volume scattering vs. surface scattering). The use of multiple resolutions is highlighted as it can provide important information when geological processes are superposed in space. The development of Geographic Information Systems offers very useful tools to the interpreters, provided the mathematical details of the different metrics are well understood, traceable and comparable. Applications of data mining and Artificial Intelligence to submarine morphology are appearing and also proving very attractive.

Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling
Aggeliki Georgiopoulou
Abstract There are a variety of methodologies to obtain seafloor sediment and rock samples, and deciding which one to use depends on the scientific question being addressed, the type of seafloor material being targeted, what the vessel can support and finally the cost. Nowadays, any type of seafloor can be sampled, no matter how soft or hard or inhospitable and technological advances, largely driven by the hydrocarbon industry, continuously allow us to go deeper and deeper into the sub-seafloor and, by definition, into geological time.
1 Introduction
Marine sediments record the Earth’s history, its climate, the ocean currents, the ocean productivity, sea level changes, sea temperature changes, tectonic movements, environmental changes, evolution and ecology among other parameters. Therefore, it has always been important to be able to collect sediment cores as they offer us a window through geological time. The longer the sediment sample the longer the time record we can study. Nonetheless, not all research vessels can support long and heavy corers whose operation is more costly financially and timewise. There are many sampling devices each with advantages and disadvantages and it is important to choose the appropriate device depending on the research question. For example, there is no need to use a giant piston corer if the research question relates with the sediment-water interface. Users must always be aware of the research vessel capabilities, its cranes, winches and wires. It is important to note that seafloor sampling and site selection need to be supported and guided by an acoustic pre-site survey, such as seafloor backscatter imaging (Chapter “Sidescan Sonar”), bathymetric surveying (Chapter “Multibeam

Echosounders”) and high-resolution seismic profiling (Chapter “Reflection and Refraction Seismic Methods”), in order to decide on the best location for coring, both for optimum sample retrieval but also for the safety of the instrument. It is also crucial to be aware that coring tends to oversample the top 10–15 m by about 3035% (Széréméta et al. 2004).
2 Surface Sediment Sampling
2.1 Dredging
Dredging is a technique that has not changed much over the years. It is used to collect loose rocks that sit on the seafloor in order to understand the distribution and genetic processes of hard rocks that shape the seafloor morphology. Dredging uses a chain-link mesh bag with a metal-jawed opening, about 1 m wide, that gets dragged along the seafloor and collects the loose rocks in the bag. The dredge is lowered to the seafloor by a steel wire cable whose length needs to be significantly longer than the water depth to allow for the dragging on the seafloor operation. An anchor chain provides the necessary weight to keep the equipment on the seafloor during dredging.
2.2 Box Corer
This corer has been developed to take a 50–60 cm2 seafloor sample, down to a depth of 45–60 cm below the seafloor, depending on the set up. The corer consists of a gimballed sample box and spade assembly (Fig. 1), originally designed by Reineck (1963). Some box corers operate with one spade, others with two, but on the same principle. The sample box is covered by two flaps that remain open while the corer is descending, allowing the water to flow freely through. During descent the spade(s) is kept with a lock mechanism on the side of the sample box. The corer is lowered to the seafloor at a controlled speed until its frame rests on the seafloor. The sample box then sinks into the sediment under its own weight. As soon as the corer is pulled by its wire, a mechanism releases the spade that swings below the sample box, sealing the sediment in. At the same time the spring-loaded flaps above the sample box shut to prevent the sediment being disturbed during recovery. This technique is favoured when the seafloor is soft and when the seafloor surface needs to be retrieved undisturbed, however the penetration is shallow.
2.3 Grab Sampler
The grab sampler consists of two quadrant shaped jaws, a clamshell bucket, made of stainless steel mounted onto a frame (Fig. 2). Lead weights can be attached to the
76 A. Georgiopoulou


frame to allow the sampler better penetration depending on the sediment type. The grab sampler is lowered to the seafloor with the jaws open. A trigger mechanism releases the jaws when the sampler comes in contact with the seafloor. As soon as retrieval begins, the pull triggers the jaws to close and retrieve the sediment. This is one of the easiest sediment sampling techniques but it also causes the most disturbance. For this reason it is commonly used to retrieve rock samples, e.g. from volcanic environments.
2.4 ROV Push Cores
The operation and practices of Remotely Operated Vehicles is addressed in Chapter “ROVs and AUVs”. Here we are only mentioning the ability to collect short push cores from carefully selected areas in real time as they are being imaged by video. Short cores, up to 30 cm in length can be pushed by the ROV arm into the seafloor (Fig. 3). The core is then retrieved and pushed into a rubber-ended lid to ensure maximum retrieval of sediment. There are certain disadvantages in using this technique, the corer is very short and a lot of material may be lost while securing the core onto the rubber-ended lid when the sediments are soft and particularly unconsolidated. The advantage is that this technique is ideal for ground-truthing bathymetry and

backscatter data very fast and efficiently as the sampling location is selected by video and it can be clearly seen how representative of the extended area the sample is.
3 Shallow Sediment Coring
3.1 Gravity Corer
Gravity corers are usually chosen to collect cohesive soft sediments; therefore, this method is extensively used on the continental slope and in deeper basins. Thin sands encased in cohesive muddier sediments can also be retrieved with this method and so it is also often used on the continental shelf, albeit these cores may be shorter due to the friction generated by the sands on the corer lining. Its name demonstrates its mode of operation, lead weights attached to the top of the corer are used to lower it to the seafloor and drive it through (Fig. 4). The weight varies between 100 to 1000 kg but can sometimes exceed two tons; therefore, a powerful winch and wire are required to lower it to the seafloor. The corer is also fitted with stabilising fins to ensure that the corer penetrates the seabed in a straight line. Most commonly a 6 or 9 m set up is used, although multiple steel core barrels can be used to make the corer longer. Usually it is not recommended to exceed 15 m because of the weight that may cause the corer to buckle when it comes in contact with the seafloor. The barrel is fitted with a sharpened replaceable carbon

78 A. Georgiopoulou


steel core cutter to ensure minimal disturbance as the corer penetrates the seafloor. Sample loss on retrieval is minimised by a core catcher fitted inside the end of the barrel. This method’s advantage is that there is little cost associated with it, it is simple, easy to use and requires little maintenance. However, it may cause compression to the sediments, especially near the top and in particular if the sediments are soft, due to the large weight on the top.

3.2 Piston Corer
The piston corer was invented in 1947 by Professor Borje Kullenberg (Kullenberg 1947) to allow the Swedish Deep Sea Expedition to take long (up to 24 m) samples of sediment from beneath the seafloor. Nowadays, together with the Gravity Corer, it is one of the more common shallow sediment sampling methods. The length can be adjusted by adding more barrels. The total barrel length is usually up to 24 m, but can be longer.

80 A. Georgiopoulou


The piston corer consists of a tight-fitting piston inside the core barrel. The system requires a triggering mechanism, which will allow it to freefall from several meters above the seafloor. The role of the triggering device is usually performed by a short (1 m) gravity core, which is commonly called the trigger weight core. The trigger weight core hangs from a release arm (pelican) several meters below the base of the piston corer (Fig. 5). Several meters of wire are coiled between the pelican and the piston corer. Upon impact of the trigger weight core with the seafloor the triggering device releases the coiled wire and activates the free fall (Fig. 5). The piston corer uses its freefall kinetic energy and own weight to drive the core barrel into the seabed. As the barrel penetrates the seabed, the piston action reduces the effect of internal wall friction thus increasing seabed penetration and thereby permits the collection of long, relatively undisturbed sediment samples. A special valve may exist in the piston to allow the operator to select the maximum under-pressure required to prevent the PVC core liner from imploding. The length of the wire coiled in the pelican depends on the type of sediment being sampled, the water depth and the length of corer being used. Ideally the length of the wire is calculated so that the piston begins to move up the core barrel just ahead of the sediment. If it moves faster or slower it will cause sediment disturbance. The length of sediment recovered depends on the nature of the sediment being sampled. Generally soft sediments such as muds and clays are easier to penetrate, while water-saturated sands and foraminiferal oozes less so. When different types of sediments alternate, as is often the case in abyssal plains, the length of core recovery depends on the relative thicknesses of the “difficult” layers.
3.3 Kasten Corer
A kasten corer is a variation of the standard gravity coring. It was designed by Kögler (1963). The steel barrels are square-shaped, made of sheet metal, either 15 or 30 cm2, with a square core catcher attached to the nose of the barrel. No liner is used. A cutter section fitted to the end of the sample tube has two spring loaded flaps, which close when the Corer is withdrawn from the sediment. The sample tube is designed to be split to gain access to the sample. Square plastic boxes (usually up to 1 m long) must be pushed into the sediment to subsample the corer. Kasten corers are designed to retrieve large volumes of sediment. This is why this method is particularly favoured where specific target components are known to occur in low amounts, e.g. biogenic material. The maximum length for kasten cores is 15 m.
3.4 Vibrocorer
The vibrocorer has a vibrating mechanism, the vibrohead, which operates with hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical or electrical power from an external source. The
Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling 81


power source stays on the ship and the corer, which is often fixed to a rig that can firmly rest on the seabed (Fig. 6), is lowered to the seafloor while still being connected through cables with the power generator on the ship. The core barrel is driven into the sediment by the force of gravity, enhanced by the vibration energy. The vibration reduces friction and facilitates core penetration into the substrate. When the corer has penetrated fully into the sediment, the vibration is switched off and the barrel pulled and retrieved, with the core catcher at the nose of the barrel preventing the sediment from being lost. Vibrocoring is the preferred technique when dealing with unconsolidated, heterogeneous sediments, such as compact sands and stiff clays or even unconsolidated chalk, but if the vibration force is high enough it is able to sample consolidated sediments too. It is also effective with glacial shelf sediments. However, due to the need for power connection the water depth to which this corer

82 A. Georgiopoulou


can be used is often limited. Disturbance to the sediment due to the vibration is limited to the few millimetres adjacent to the tube and the surface sediment that may be stirred up by the corer as it penetrates, but the centre of the core is usually intact.
3.5 Multi-corer and Mega Corer
When multiple samples are needed from the same location, a multi-corer or a mega corer are the most time-efficient ways to retrieve them. Multiple plastic tubes are fixed to a tubular frame with a sampling head attached to it by a hydraulic damper (Fig. 7). Lead weights attached to the head allows for regulation of the depth of samples taken. The corer is slowly lowered until it rests on the seafloor. The core tubes penetrate the sediment under the force of gravity but at a controlled rate regulated by the hydraulic damper and the lead weight on the head. A series of spring-loaded arms swing under the tubes to seal the sediment in and plug the top of the tubes to prevent disturbance when the corer is pulled for retrieval (like the hammer spade in the box corer). This method is preferred when multiple samples are needed from the same site but also when the sediment-water interface needs to be sampled as this is the most efficient method of retrieving it.

3.6 Giant Piston Corer and the CALYPSO Corer
The Giant piston corer was designed by Hollister et al. (1973) to obtain long piston cores from large water depths (5000 m). The length that can be achieved is usually 30–40 m. The device is not much different to the conventional piston corer with only a few modifications to its diameter (14 cm outside, 11.5 cm inner diameter), larger weights (up to 6 tons) and, most notably, a parachute to control the speed of penetration and avoid over-penetrating and compressing the sediments. The CALYPSO piston corer, is a giant piston corer that was developed onboard R/V Marion Dufresne and is used to collect even longer cores, up to 75 m in length at full ocean depth. The corer is deployed using a specially made wire that prevents it from rotating and is weightless in the water (Aramide cable). It can be triggered using either a counter weight similar to the trigger weight core as described above for the conventional piston corer or by using a programmable acoustic release, both of which enable the corer to freefall.

4 Seafloor Drilling
Most seafloor shaping processes last for long periods, in the order of thousands to millions of years, whether volcanic or sedimentary. Marine geomorphologists ideally prefer to have access to a longer record in order to understand the present-day seafloor morphology and to that vein techniques that drill into the seafloor and generate longer and continuous records of samples are commonly pursued. However, seafloor drilling is a technologically demanding, difficult and expensive activity and therefore not easily employed. The oil and gas industry operations produce samples that are ideal for use in marine geomorphology and frequently this data is made available to researchers. Correspondingly, the International Ocean Discovery Programme (IODP) provides similar datasets, but the actual operation takes many years of planning. There are other seafloor drills, such as the FUGRO seafloor drill and the MARUM MeBo, that have shallower sub-seafloor reach but that are more flexible and mobile than the oil and gas industry or the IODP and consequently easier to use. Below are descriptions of the operations of these three types of drilling techniques. Other seafloor drills are available but not described here as they operate at similar principles.
4.1 Oil and Gas Industry Operations
Offshore drilling has had to adapt to considerably challenging environments of variable water depths ranging from relatively shallow water on the continental shelf to deep water slopes and ultra-deep water basins. This has resulted in the development of three main types of drilling rigs, each one appropriate for different water depths and specific local conditions (geology, weather). Based on operation those three types are Jack-up rigs, semi-submersibles and drillships. Jack-up rigs are the most commonly used worldwide. They operate in shallow water depths, up to 150 m, and preferably on a firm seafloor. The rig is floated into position and three or four legs are lowered and penetrate the seafloor for stability. Jack-ups are self-elevating and stand clear of the highwater level. In deeper water depths (up to 500 m) or unstable seafloor a semi-submersible rig is used, which is a mobile and floating rig, with a platform on a submerged framework kept buoyant with ballasted columns and watertight pontoons that sit about 20 m below the water surface and below fairweather wave base, providing some relative stability. Mooring lines anchored to the seafloor and dynamic positioning keep the rig in position. In fact dynamic positioning can in some cases completely replace anchored moorings. Finally, for deeper water locations, drillships have been constructed, which could be used in water depths in excess of 3500 m. These can work in any water depth apart from very shallow water. They are ship-shaped and this allows them total mobility and can be mobilised globally to even the remotest areas. However, they are particularly affected by weather conditions. Other rig types
Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling 85


include drill barges, tender-assist rigs, compliant towers, platform rigs and Spar rigs. The deepest floating rig is the Perdido Spar in the Gulf of Mexico at a water depth of about 2450 m operated by Shell Oil. When discoveries are made temporary exploratory wells reveal shows and serve also to assess the quality of the hydrocarbon before proceeding to the drilling of a production well. Exploratory wells that find oil or gas where neither has been found before are called wild cats. If a well strikes oil or gas it is called discovery well. Step-out or appraisal wells are drilled either to determine the limits of a field following discovery or to explore for other reservoirs in the vicinity of known fields. When a well is unsuccessful in finding oil or gas it is called a dry well. The most common drilling technique is rotary drilling where a drill bit is screwed to the end of a drill string, which is made of a set of drill pipes (about 9 m long each). The drill bit attached to the drill string is lowered through the water until it reaches the seafloor. A hole in commenced, or spudded, with the rotary steel-toothed or diamond-studded bit. Cooling, cleaning and pressure stabilisation is achieved by using a drilling fluid, which is pumped through the drill pipe and out through the drill bit and back up the hole to the mud pits on the drilling rig, before it gets recirculated. The drilling fluid may be a mixture of sea water, clay such as barite and bentonite, and other chemicals. The initial hole is usually 36 in. in diameter. Each time the bit drills the equivalent of one pipe length, drilling stops for another joint of pipe to be added to the drill string (making a connection). The hole needs to be cased to prevent collapse or caving. Casing is achieved by cementing a steel pipe to the rock wall of the hole. A smaller diameter hole can then be drilled from the base of the first hole, which will also be cased by cementing steel pipes to the hole walls but also the larger diameter hole above it and so on. The hole keeps getting lengthened this way with ever narrower diameter. Wireline logging is performed before the casing is cemented to the walls. Sitting on the seafloor and connected to the top of the hole is the “blow-out preventer” (BOP), which consists of a series of pipes and valves to prevent the sudden rush of fluid or gas to the seafloor in case overpressurised oil or gas are unexpectedly encountered. Other drilling methods include percussion drilling which involves crushing the rock by raising and dropping a heavy chisel bit, rotary percussion drilling which is a combination method that uses a rotary drill that also pounds into the rocks, sonic (vibratory) drilling which uses a sonic drill that generates high frequency resonant vibrations that cause magnification of the amplitude of the drill bit and fluidisation of particles, and directional drilling which is rotary drilling but directed along a curved path as the hole deepens. For further information, the reader is directed to more dedicated books and publications, such as Tanaka et al. (2005), Devold (2009), Offshore Operations Subgroup (2011) and a plethora of websites (e.g. http://www.petroleumonline.com/ and http://www.slb.com/services/drilling.aspx).

4.2 International Ocean Discovery Program
Benefiting from the technology developed by the oil and gas industry, and particularly dynamic positioning which can keep vessels on target in strong currents, scientific deep sea drilling became possible. Originally called the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), it started in 1966, using the Drilling Vessel Glomar Challenger. In 1985 it became the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) when the Glomar Challenger was decommissioned and replaced by the JOIDES Resolution. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) continued using a refurbished JOIDES Resolution and the Japanese Deep Sea Drilling Vessel Chikyu (Japanese for Planet Earth). In addition, a third component, so called Mission Specific Platforms, were added for settings, where none of the above mentioned drill ships can operate (e.g., ice-covered regions and very shallow water conditions) (Fig. 8). As of 2013 the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program continues under the new collaboration of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) (Fig. 9). IODP uses multiple drilling platforms to access different sub-seafloor environments during research expeditions. Their website is a very valuable source of information and details on the tools and techniques they use (http://iodp.tamu.edu/ tools/index.html). The JOIDES Resolution has riser-less drilling technology, which uses seawater as the primary drilling fluid, pumped into the drillpipe. The role of the seawater is to cool and clean the drill bit as well as deliver cuttings out of the hole to a cone on the vessel. On the other hand, Chikyu operates with riser technology. It uses an outer casing that surrounds the drill pipe, which provides return circulation of engineered drilling fluid maintaining the pressure in the hole at an equilibrium. At the same time cuttings are removed and the drill hole is cleaned allowing for deeper drilling. A blowout preventer (BOP) protects from overpressure build-up. A tall metal drilling rig allows to conduct rotary drilling with the Rotary Core Barrel, which is the oldest and most basic technique and is used to retrieve medium to hard lithified sediments and crystalline rock cores.

Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling 87


Other coring techniques include the Hydraulic Piston Corer (HPC) and the Advanced Piston Corer (APC), which are push-type, no rotation involved and use hydraulic actuated piston coring (http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/index.html). This technique is ideal for climate and palaeoceanographic studies as it retrieves the least disturbed sediments but on the downside, it is limited to the upper 200 m. The Half-Length APC (HLAPC) is a shorter version of the APC and is used to recover high-quality, high-resolution cores from short intervals of soft sediments between harder layers, such as oozes, between chert layers. For the recovery of deeper but more consolidated sediments the Extended Core Barrel (XCB) can be used. It is usually deployed when the sediments are too stiff for the piston corer but too soft for the RCB. It is interchangeable with the HPC and APC, depending on the sediments encountered. The operation of the XCB uses rotation of the drill string to advance the hole while the cutting shoe trims the sample. IODP holes can be re-entered at a later stage with technologies such as the Free-Fall Funnel (FFF) and the Reentry Cone and Casing (RECC), the latter being a permanent seafloor installation. The RECC allows multiple visits to the same hole deepening it or installing permanent/long-term downhole measuring and sampling.

Apart from the core retrieval, downhole logging typically takes place in an IODP hole, which includes standard wireline logging (i.e. porosity, litho-density, natural gamma ray, enhanced digital telemetry, resistivity imaging, magnetic susceptibility, sonic imaging, microscanning, inclinometry and borehole seismic) and downhole memory measurements (temperature of rocks and sediments, pressure in soft sediments, magnetic orientation, etc.). Downhole logging can either be performed after drilling, lowering the logging tools through the open hole, which is the conventional method, or while drilling (Logging While Drilling—LWD), allowing real time data feedback. The latter is preferred when hole conditions are expected to be unsuitable for conventional wireline logging.
4.3 Seafloor Drill Rigs
Access to IODP vessels is limited and requires many years of planning, while other drill ships are expensive. An intermediate coring technique, bridging the gap between IODP and the standard coring tools described above, are seafloor drill rigs. There is a variety of seafloor drills operational in the world, used commercially and academically. A seafloor drill is lowered onto the seafloor from a purpose-built research vessel on an umbilical cable that provides control, communications, power and hoist capability. It may have a single core barrel that can drill to a depth of 5 m or may be equipped with a drill-pipe magazine that can take multiple barrels which allows to drill to greater depths by attaching extension pipes to the drill string (Freudenthal and Wefer 2013). Commercial seafloor drills include the Fugro Seafloor Drill that can retrieve samples up to 150 m below the seafloor at water depths up to 4000 m, the Portable Remotely Operated Drill (PROD) that can operate at waterdepths of 3000 m and retrieve more than 130 m of core and the Underwater Seafloor Drilling Rig (USDR) that has no water depth limit of operation (Sheshtawy 2007), amongst many others. The British Geological Survey (BGS) rockdrill can retrieve up to 50 m of core at water depths up to 3000 m, which originally could only retrieve 5 m when it was initially conceived in 1982 (Wilson 2006). Development was and still is continuous with updates in software, camera, cable and connectors technologies, but also in progressing from a single barrel to a multi-barrel operation (Wilson 2006). BGS also operate an orientated rockdrill, which can be deployed at 4500 m water depth and which allows for cores to be orientated with reference to a compass heading and thus it is used in palaeomagnetic analysis (Wilson 2006). MeBo (Meeresborden-Bohrgerät) (Fig. 10a) was developed by Marum, the Centre for Marine Environmental Sciences of the University of Bremen, Germany (Freudenthal and Wefer 2006, 2007, 2013) and can drill cores up to 80 m deep in unconsolidated sediments and in hard rocks at water depths up to 2000 m. The drill rig is powered by four hydraulic pumps. MeBo combines rotary and push operation; the drill head is mounted on a guide that moves up and down that generates a maximum push force of 4 tons. Seawater is pumped through the drill string to cool
Seafloor Sediment and Rock Sampling 89


and clean the drill bit from cuttings. Barrels are taken off the magazine and threaded to the drill head as drilling progresses (Fig. 10b). Every three meters of sampling the barrel gets stored together with the drilled core in the magazine and the next empty barrel is lowered to the drill hole and attached to the drill head, a 3 m rod is added and drilling continues. The MeBo 200 is the latest development of this tool. It can recover cores up to 200 m length.
5 Core Handling
Users need to be aware that improper handling or faults in the design of the coring device may result in severely disturbed and unrepresentative samples. The most common and most severe problems that may arise are (1) loss of surface sediment (the seafloor), (2) redistribution and resuspension of enclosed sediment (running along the core liner), and (3) repenetration (bounce of the device after penetrating partially and then repenetrating in same location) (Blomqvist 1991). Other problems may arise from compaction of layers and shortening, particularly towards the base of the core, or extension and sediment stretching near the top of the core (Skinner and McCave 2003; Széréméta et al. 2004). When cores are retrieved on deck they are labelled and cut into 1–1.5 m sections to make transportation and handing easier. Soft sediment cores are stored in fridges kept at 4 °C temperature, simulating deep sea temperatures, in order to maintain their moisture and chemistry. To analyse the sediment, cores are split into two halves, one is labelled “Working” and is used for sampling and the other is labelled “Archive” (Fig. 11) and is kept intact for posterity.

Multiple analyses can then be performed on the working half, starting with non-destructive methods, such as physical properties logging (Multi-Sensor Core Logger) and elemental composition scanning (ITRAX) (e.g. Georgiopoulou et al. 2012). Destructive methods that require subsampling need to be performed last and modestly so as not to oversample the core.
