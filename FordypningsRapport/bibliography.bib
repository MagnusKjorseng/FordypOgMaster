	abstract = {Construction A non-buoyant ROV for underwater use has been developed. It is heavy and powerful and is normally suspended in a wire from a crane. The operation of the ROV is from the deck and the control signals and power are fed through umbilical cable which is kept taut at all times. The ROV is equipped with 3 thrusters placed 1200 apart and operating in the horizontal plane. With the aid of a joystick, the operator can deflect the Spider with load, away from the vertical. The load and Spider may also be rotated. Working tools may be placed on this particular ROV.},

	abstract = {Unoccupied Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are growing in importance and capabilities. Here, the trajectory control of an UUV carrying an object is investigated, with the consequent changes in system dynamics. For the ﬁrst time, an Adaptive Model Predictive Control (AMPC) scheme for UUVs is developed, which selects optimal actions at the start of every time step to minimise the trajectory tracking error and prevent excessive changes in the control action over a receding time horizon. Prediction error minimisation is used to identify the linear model of the UUV in real time. The performance of AMPC is compared with existing PID and sliding-mode control (SMC) strategies through simulations. The latter is improved to prevent integral wind-up. While SMC results in best tracking performance, it imposes a strong burden on the motors due to its bang-bang action selection. AMPC presents smoother changes in applied thrust, but higher tracking errors due to non-linear eﬀects and inaccuracies in the on-line system identiﬁcation process. PID presents best overall performance, but its behaviour is expected to degrade on an actual ROV application due to sensor noise. This study will contribute to the selection of a suitable control scheme for future UUVs performing maintenance tasks autonomously.},

The presented model is implemented in Matlab and takes into account the most important eﬀects related to the response of underwater cables and ROVs. Following beam theory bending stiﬀness is also included, making the model applicable for low tension scenarios. The presented model is modiﬁed to allow for compression of the cable.

	abstract = {Human-in-the-loop (HITL) system is referred to as a promising technology to extend human actions and intelligences to deep ocean. Many applications of HITL demand the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to track a desired target point. However, the cyber- and physical-constrained characteristics on ROV make it challenging to achieve the tracking task. This paper is concerned with a tracking control problem for the ROV, subjected to time-varying delay in cyber channels and actuator saturation in physical channels. We design a model-free proportional-derivative (PD) controller to enforce the position tracking of ROV. For the proposed controller, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions are constructed to analyze the stability, and then the sufficient conditions are provided to show that the tracking controller can stabilize ROV. In order to estimate and optimize the domain of attraction (DOA), the stability conditions are rearranged into a form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), through which the required initial stability conditions can be developed. Finally, simulation and experiment results are performed to validate the effectiveness. It is demonstrated that the designed tracking controller can guarantee asymptotic stability, while the DOA in this paper can be significantly enlarged as compared with the other ones.},

	abstract = {Dynamical positioning (DP) control of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) using thrusters is investigated as a means to increase operability of its launch and recovery system (LARS) on relatively small surface vessels. The ROV uses its DP control system to dynamically track the wave-driven motion of the surface vessel that may also be under DP control. We consider the critical phase when the ROV position is very close to the LARS. In this phase, the ROV’s motion is strongly influenced by first-order surface waves and hydrodynamic couplings from the surface vessel motion. Hence, there is risk of collision between the ROV and the surface vessel and its LARS. We employ a time-domain dynamic system simulator that calculates the coupled motions of both the surface vessel and the ROV to analyse and optimize the operability of the system. It is based on coupled added mass, damping and wave force response amplitude operators (RAO) for both the surface vessel and the ROV, which can be calculated using WAMIT coupled hydrodynamic multi-body computations, accounting also for the moonpool water column dynamics. Simulation results show the positive effect of the ROV DP on the operability of the LARS using statistical environmental data from the North Sea.},

When manned submersibles and AUVs perform small-scale accurate measurements, the research vessel R/V supports both submersible types for diving operations and has a positioning and communication time allocation mechanism for cooperative operations. Through the analysis of the operating efficiency of different modes, we found that the cooperative operational mode based on the pure research vessel R/V is suitable for local small-scale accurate detection, and the cooperative operational mode based on the USV/lander system is suitable for large-scale and long-distance underwater operations.},

Moreover, two rectangular cubic models with fillet and sharp edges are modeled for comparative study. The wind tunnel and the finite volume methods are used for experimental and numerical simulations, respectively, and the Menter’s SST k-ω model is employed to simulate the turbulent flow. The leading edge geometry, angle of attack, and Reynolds number are found to be the most effective factors on the drag forces. Additionally, the fillet edge model had better hydrodynamic performance than the ROV and the sharp edge rectangular cubic model considerably.},

The umbilical is equipped with moving ballasts and buoys to give it a predictable shape with straight lines: simple mathematical models of the umbilical can thus be defined. Using these models and measuring the angles at the ends of the cable, the position of the ROV can be found. Three umbilical models with different equipment are proposed. The methods were tested in a pool and the estimated position of the ROV was compared with its actual position measured using a motion capture system.},

The umbilical cable usually amplifies the motion amplitude of the mother ship owing to its elastic material. Under the joint action of the mother ship motion and ocean current, the strong internal force waves generated in the umbilical cable tend to cause serious accidents such as umbilical cable breakage. Based on the Kirchhoff rod theory, a dynamic model of an umbilical cable under complex sea conditions is established. The differential quadrature method and Newmark method are used to discretize the equation in the space and time domains. The characteristics of the umbilical cable under different conditions are analyzed. The results show that the amplitude amplification rate of the umbilical cable is directly proportional to the velocity of the ocean current and amplitude of the mother ship motion, and inversely proportional to the period of the mother ship motion. When the length of the umbilical cable changes, the amplitude amplification rate reaches a maximum at 3000 m.},

	abstract = {The fate of mismanaged plastic waste released into oceans (ocean plastics) remains a topic of debate, where the mass imbalance between the leakage and abundance in the world's oceans appears paradoxical. In the present study, a budget for ocean plastic mass was estimated based on a combination of numerical particle tracking and linear mass-balance models, both validated using a worldwide ocean plastic dataset. Integrating the time series of worldwide macroplastic emission from both rivers and the fisheries industry over the period 1961–2017 yielded a total mass of 25.3 million metric tonnes (MMT). Macro- and microplastics currently floating in the oceans, and microplastics on beaches, each account for 3–4\% of the ocean plastics emitted worldwide to date. Overall, 23.4\% of ocean plastics were macroplastics on beaches. Meanwhile, 66.7\% of ocean plastics were heavier than seawater or microplastics removed from the upper ocean and beaches, which are difficult to monitor under current observation frameworks adopted worldwide. However, the present study on ocean plastics suggested that the whole ocean plastics accounted for only 4.7\% of mismanaged plastic waste (542.2 MMT) generated between the 1960s and today.},

	abstract = {Engineering and civil developments have relied on synthetic polymers and plastics (including polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, etc.) for decades, especially where their durability protects engineering structures against corrosion and other environmental stimuli. Offshore oil and gas infrastructure and renewable energy platforms are typical examples, where these plastics (100,000 s of metric tonnes worldwide) are used primarily as functional material to protect metallic flowlines and subsea equipment against seawater corrosion. Despite this, the current literature on polymers is limited to sea-surface environments, and a model for subsea degradation of plastics is needed. In this review, we collate relevant studies on the degradation of plastics and synthetic polymers in marine environments to gain insight into the fate of these materials when left in subsea conditions. We present a new mathematical model that accounts for various physicochemical changes in the oceanic environment as a function of depth to predict the lifespan of synthetic plastics and the possible formation of plastic debris, e.g., microplastics. We found that the degradation rate of the plastics decreases significantly as a function of water depth and can be estimated quantitatively by the mathematical model that accounts for the effect (and sensitivity) of geographical location, temperature, light intensity, hydrostatic pressure, and marine sediments. For instance, it takes a subsea polyethylene coating about 800 years to degrade on ocean floor (as opposed to {\textless}400 years in shallow coastal waters), generating 1000s of particles per g of degradation under certain conditions. Our results demonstrate how suspended sediments in the water column are likely to compensate for the decreasing depth-corrected degradation rates, resulting in surface abrasion and the formation of plastic debris such as microplastics. This review, and the complementing data, will be significant for the environmental impact assessment of plastics in subsea infrastructures. Moreover, as these infrastructures reach the end of their service life, the management of the plastic components becomes of great interest to environmental regulators, industry, and the community, considering the known sizeable impacts of plastics on global biogeochemical cycles.},
