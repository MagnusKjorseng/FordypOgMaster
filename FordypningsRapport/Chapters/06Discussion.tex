\section{Use as a rapid prototyping tool}
The solution shows a lot of promise as a rapid prototyping tool. As it stands at time of writing, the solution is fairly easy to configure for different initial conditions, depths of water/length of cable. Configuring the seastate is somewhat more complex as it's necessary to describe an elevation function for the sea surface. Sea currents also are not yet implemented, although AGX does allow for currents using the \texttt{WaterFlowGenerator} interface.
