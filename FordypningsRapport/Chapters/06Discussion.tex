\section{Use as a rapid prototyping tool}
The solution shows a lot of promise as a rapid prototyping tool. As it stands at time of writing, the solution is fairly easy to configure for different initial conditions, depths of water/length of cable. Configuring the seastate is somewhat more complex as it's necessary to describe an elevation function for the sea surface. Sea currents also are not yet implemented, although AGX does allow for currents using the \texttt{WaterFlowGenerator} interface. 


\subsection{Ease of use}

\section{Future applicability}
The goal of this project has been to make a simulation applicable to the Plan Sea project. I believe I have done this, even if it is a bit simplistic as it stands. I believe that the resulting simulation is applicable to the real-life system. 

\subsection{IRL testing proposal}
For my Master's thesis, I would like to work further on this simulator to create a well functioning control system and then apply it to the real-life vessel and ROV.
