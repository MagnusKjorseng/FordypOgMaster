The goal of this project has been to make a simulation of the Plan Sea project's proposed implementation, which consists of a small surface vessel and a non-buoyant remotely operated vehicle attached to eachother by a lifting wire. The purpose of the simulation is to allow for rapid prototyping and tuning of a control system that allows for controlling the coupled system that results. 

In this report I've documented why the simulation would be a helpful tool for prototyping, as well as how the simulation itself is set up. I've described how to use the simulation as it currently stands, its current state and results, as well as ways of expanding the simulation in the future to make it more realistic and applicable to the real world.
