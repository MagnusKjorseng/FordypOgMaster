A Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) can be used to find and grab underwater plastic litter. Lifting heavier litter is difficult however. This project simulates an ROV which is negatively buoyant, that is it sinks in water. The project uses Algoryx' AGX as a framework for simulating a coupled system consisting of a surface vessel and an ROV, connected by a flexible tether. 

The results of this project show that AGX is a usable framework for simulating this type of problem. Additionally the project has created a simulation which is usable for further work with this configuration of a non-buoyant ROV. Using the simulation, a simple proportional-derivative controller has been implemented and tested. 

The report concludes that the simulator created is useful in further exploration on the topic of non-buoyant ROVs.
