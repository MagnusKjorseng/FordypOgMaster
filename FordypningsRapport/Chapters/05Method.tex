\section{AGX}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe use as simulation framework
\item Describe sim setup
\item Discuss alternative solutions (make your own, do numerical analysis)
\item Hull and ROV shape can be exchanged, allowing for greater flexibility in a future system
\item Can be used to scale things like winch strength/responsivity or cable elasticity
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Capabilities and limitations}

\section{ROS2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use for simulation and IRL
\item assists in rapid prototyping as sim or hardware can be interchanged and the control system is agnostic to it
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Describe ROS setup with nodes used etc.}
