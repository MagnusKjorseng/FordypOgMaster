The operation of the ROV is from the deck and the control signals and power are fed through umbilical cable which is kept taut at all times. The ROV is equipped with 3 thrusters placed 1200 apart and operating in the horizontal plane. With the aid of a joystick, the operator can deflect the Spider with load, away from the vertical. The load and Spider may also be rotated. Working tools may be placed on this particular ROV.},

	abstract = {Unoccupied Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are growing in importance and capabilities. Here, the trajectory control of an UUV carrying an object is investigated, with the consequent changes in system dynamics. For the ﬁrst time, an Adaptive Model Predictive Control (AMPC) scheme for UUVs is developed, which selects optimal actions at the start of every time step to minimise the trajectory tracking error and prevent excessive changes in the control action over a receding time horizon. Prediction error minimisation is used to identify the linear model of the UUV in real time. The performance of AMPC is compared with existing PID and sliding-mode control (SMC) strategies through simulations. The latter is improved to prevent integral wind-up. While SMC results in best tracking performance, it imposes a strong burden on the motors due to its bang-bang action selection. AMPC presents smoother changes in applied thrust, but higher tracking errors due to non-linear eﬀects and inaccuracies in the on-line system identiﬁcation process. PID presents best overall performance, but its behaviour is expected to degrade on an actual ROV application due to sensor noise. This study will contribute to the selection of a suitable control scheme for future UUVs performing maintenance tasks autonomously.},

This paper presents a novel three-dimensional cable model for Remotely Operated Vehicles using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The presented model is implemented in Matlab and takes into account the most important eﬀects related to the response of underwater cables and ROVs. Following beam theory bending stiﬀness is also included, making the model applicable for low tension scenarios. The presented model is modiﬁed to allow for compression of the cable. The resulting non-linear equations are discretized spatially by the Galerkin ﬁnite element method and solved temporally by the Newmark-β time integration scheme.},

The respective model parameters are obtained from experimental data. Tuning parameters are then introduced in order to further improve the accuracy of the identiﬁed model.

	abstract = {Human-in-the-loop (HITL) system is referred to as a promising technology to extend human actions and intelligences to deep ocean. Many applications of HITL demand the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to track a desired target point. However, the cyber- and physical-constrained characteristics on ROV make it challenging to achieve the tracking task. This paper is concerned with a tracking control problem for the ROV, subjected to time-varying delay in cyber channels and actuator saturation in physical channels. We design a model-free proportional-derivative (PD) controller to enforce the position tracking of ROV. For the proposed controller, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions are constructed to analyze the stability, and then the sufficient conditions are provided to show that the tracking controller can stabilize ROV. In order to estimate and optimize the domain of attraction (DOA), the stability conditions are rearranged into a form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), through which the required initial stability conditions can be developed. Finally, simulation and experiment results are performed to validate the effectiveness. It is demonstrated that the designed tracking controller can guarantee asymptotic stability, while the DOA in this paper can be significantly enlarged as compared with the other ones.},

	abstract = {Dynamical positioning (DP) control of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) using thrusters is investigated as a means to increase operability of its launch and recovery system (LARS) on relatively small surface vessels. The ROV uses its DP control system to dynamically track the wave-driven motion of the surface vessel that may also be under DP control. We consider the critical phase when the ROV position is very close to the LARS. In this phase, the ROV’s motion is strongly influenced by first-order surface waves and hydrodynamic couplings from the surface vessel motion. Hence, there is risk of collision between the ROV and the surface vessel and its LARS. We employ a time-domain dynamic system simulator that calculates the coupled motions of both the surface vessel and the ROV to analyse and optimize the operability of the system. It is based on coupled added mass, damping and wave force response amplitude operators (RAO) for both the surface vessel and the ROV, which can be calculated using WAMIT coupled hydrodynamic multi-body computations, accounting also for the moonpool water column dynamics. Simulation results show the positive effect of the ROV DP on the operability of the LARS using statistical environmental data from the North Sea.},

When manned submersibles and AUVs perform small-scale accurate measurements, the research vessel R/V supports both submersible types for diving operations and has a positioning and communication time allocation mechanism for cooperative operations. Through the analysis of the operating efficiency of different modes, we found that the cooperative operational mode based on the pure research vessel R/V is suitable for local small-scale accurate detection, and the cooperative operational mode based on the USV/lander system is suitable for large-scale and long-distance underwater operations.},

Moreover, two rectangular cubic models with fillet and sharp edges are modeled for comparative study. The wind tunnel and the finite volume methods are used for experimental and numerical simulations, respectively, and the Menter’s SST k-ω model is employed to simulate the turbulent flow. The leading edge geometry, angle of attack, and Reynolds number are found to be the most effective factors on the drag forces. Additionally, the fillet edge model had better hydrodynamic performance than the ROV and the sharp edge rectangular cubic model considerably.},

In order to turn these constraints into advantages, this paper proposes a method to estimate the position of an ROV by observing the shape of its umbilical. The umbilical is equipped with moving ballasts and buoys to give it a predictable shape with straight lines: simple mathematical models of the umbilical can thus be defined. Using these models and measuring the angles at the ends of the cable, the position of the ROV can be found. Three umbilical models with different equipment are proposed. The methods were tested in a pool and the estimated position of the ROV was compared with its actual position measured using a motion capture system.},

The umbilical cable usually amplifies the motion amplitude of the mother ship owing to its elastic material. Under the joint action of the mother ship motion and ocean current, the strong internal force waves generated in the umbilical cable tend to cause serious accidents such as umbilical cable breakage. Based on the Kirchhoff rod theory, a dynamic model of an umbilical cable under complex sea conditions is established. The differential quadrature method and Newmark method are used to discretize the equation in the space and time domains. The characteristics of the umbilical cable under different conditions are analyzed. The results show that the amplitude amplification rate of the umbilical cable is directly proportional to the velocity of the ocean current and amplitude of the mother ship motion, and inversely proportional to the period of the mother ship motion. When the length of the umbilical cable changes, the amplitude amplification rate reaches a maximum at 3000 m.},

By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million MT entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.},

	abstract = {The fate of mismanaged plastic waste released into oceans (ocean plastics) remains a topic of debate, where the mass imbalance between the leakage and abundance in the world's oceans appears paradoxical. In the present study, a budget for ocean plastic mass was estimated based on a combination of numerical particle tracking and linear mass-balance models, both validated using a worldwide ocean plastic dataset. Integrating the time series of worldwide macroplastic emission from both rivers and the fisheries industry over the period 1961–2017 yielded a total mass of 25.3 million metric tonnes (MMT). Macro- and microplastics currently floating in the oceans, and microplastics on beaches, each account for 3–4\% of the ocean plastics emitted worldwide to date. Overall, 23.4\% of ocean plastics were macroplastics on beaches. Meanwhile, 66.7\% of ocean plastics were heavier than seawater or microplastics removed from the upper ocean and beaches, which are difficult to monitor under current observation frameworks adopted worldwide. However, the present study on ocean plastics suggested that the whole ocean plastics accounted for only 4.7\% of mismanaged plastic waste (542.2 MMT) generated between the 1960s and today.},

	abstract = {Engineering and civil developments have relied on synthetic polymers and plastics (including polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, etc.) for decades, especially where their durability protects engineering structures against corrosion and other environmental stimuli. Offshore oil and gas infrastructure and renewable energy platforms are typical examples, where these plastics (100,000 s of metric tonnes worldwide) are used primarily as functional material to protect metallic flowlines and subsea equipment against seawater corrosion. Despite this, the current literature on polymers is limited to sea-surface environments, and a model for subsea degradation of plastics is needed. In this review, we collate relevant studies on the degradation of plastics and synthetic polymers in marine environments to gain insight into the fate of these materials when left in subsea conditions. We present a new mathematical model that accounts for various physicochemical changes in the oceanic environment as a function of depth to predict the lifespan of synthetic plastics and the possible formation of plastic debris, e.g., microplastics. We found that the degradation rate of the plastics decreases significantly as a function of water depth and can be estimated quantitatively by the mathematical model that accounts for the effect (and sensitivity) of geographical location, temperature, light intensity, hydrostatic pressure, and marine sediments. For instance, it takes a subsea polyethylene coating about 800 years to degrade on ocean floor (as opposed to {\textless}400 years in shallow coastal waters), generating 1000s of particles per g of degradation under certain conditions. Our results demonstrate how suspended sediments in the water column are likely to compensate for the decreasing depth-corrected degradation rates, resulting in surface abrasion and the formation of plastic debris such as microplastics. This review, and the complementing data, will be significant for the environmental impact assessment of plastics in subsea infrastructures. Moreover, as these infrastructures reach the end of their service life, the management of the plastic components becomes of great interest to environmental regulators, industry, and the community, considering the known sizeable impacts of plastics on global biogeochemical cycles.},

Thus, in this work we review the evidence for potential negative effects of microplastics in the human body, focusing on pathways of exposure and toxicity. Exposure may occur by ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact due to the presence of microplastics in products, foodstuff and air. In all biological systems, microplastic exposure may cause particle toxicity, with oxidative stress, inflammatory lesions and increased uptake or translocation. The inability of the immune system to remove synthetic particles may lead to chronic inflammation and increase risk of neoplasia. Furthermore, microplastics may release their constituents, adsorbed contaminants and pathogenic organisms. Nonetheless, knowledge on microplastic toxicity is still limited and largely influenced by exposure concentration, particle properties, adsorbed contaminants, tissues involved and individual susceptibility, requiring further research.},

	abstract = {Background The environmental pollution by microplastics is a global problem arising from the extensive production and use of plastics. Small particles of different plastics, measured less than 5 mm in diameter, are found in water, air, soil, and various living organisms around the globe. Humans constantly inhale and ingest these particles. The associated health risks raise major concerns and require dedicated evaluation. Objectives In this review we systematize and summarize the effects of microplastics on the health of different animals. The article would be of interest to ecologists, experimental biologists, environmental physicians, and all those concerned with anthropogenic environmental changes. Methodology We searched PubMed and Scopus from the period of 01/2010 to 09/2021 for peer-reviewed scientific publications focused on (1) environmental pollution with microplastics; (2) uptake of microplastics by humans; and (3) the impact of microplastics on animal health. Results The number of published studies considering the effects of microplastic particles on aquatic organisms is considerable. In aquatic invertebrates, microplastics cause a decline in feeding behavior and fertility, slow down larval growth and development, increase oxygen consumption, and stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. In fish, the microplastics may cause structural damage to the intestine, liver, gills, and brain, while affecting metabolic balance, behavior, and fertility; the degree of these harmful effects depends on the particle sizes and doses, as well as the exposure parameters. The corresponding data for terrestrial mammals are less abundant: only 30 papers found in PubMed and Scopus deal with the effects of microplastics in laboratory mice and rats; remarkably, about half of these papers were published in 2021, indicating the growing interest of the scientific community in this issue. The studies demonstrate that in mice and rats microplastics may also cause biochemical and structural damage with noticeable dysfunctions of the intestine, liver, and excretory and reproductive systems. Conclusions Microplastics pollute the seas and negatively affect the health of aquatic organisms. The data obtained in laboratory mice and rats suggest a profound negative influence of microplastics on human health. However, given significant variation in plastic types, particle sizes, doses, models, and modes of administration, the available experimental data are still fragmentary and controversial.},

	abstract = {Background As a result of human socioeconomic activity, industrial wastes have increased distressingly. Plastic pollution is globally distributed across the world due to its properties of buoyancy and durability. A big health hazard is the sorption of toxicants to plastic while traveling through the environment. Two broad classes of plastic-related chemicals are of critical concern for human health—bisphenols and phthalates. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disruptor compound (EDC) with estrogenic activity. It is used in the production of materials that are used daily. The endocrine modulating activity of BPA and its effects on reproductive health has been widely studied. BPA also has effects on the immune system; however, they are poorly investigated and the available data are inconclusive. Phthalates are also EDCs used as plasticizers in a wide array of daily-use products. Since these compounds are not covalently bound to the plastic matrix, they easily leach out from it, leading to high human exposure. These compounds exert several cell effects through modulating different endocrine pathways, such as estrogen, androgen, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and arylhydrocarbon receptor pathways. The exposure to both classes of plastic derivatives during critical periods has detrimental effects on human health. Methods In this review, we have compiled the most important of their perinatal effects on the function of the immune system and their relationship to the development of different types of cancer. Results/Conclusion The administration of bisphenols and phthalates during critical stages of development affects important immune system components, and the immune function; which might be related to the development of different diseases including cancer.},

	abstract = {Plastic leachates are priority pollutants considered dangerous to health. Large amounts of plastic waste are disposed of daily with less biodegradability. These plastic materials often disintegrate into tiny sizes that can leach into the groundwater, agricultural soil, and foods. Chemical leachates from plastic additives like Bisphenol A (BPA), plasticisers (phthalates and their esters), flame retardants, antioxidants, acid scavengers, and lubricants do not covalently bind tightly to the plastic moiety, and thus break away through various processes into the environment, food, water, air, skin, and the nose, where they facilitate endocrine disruption and other serious health disorders. Synthetic plastic polymers that are classified according to their physical and chemical properties into polyethylene terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polycarbonates are produced readily, littered due to their high demands. Hence, the use of glass material, paper, jute, and other bioplastics made of renewable materials is encouraged to assuage the health risk implication of plastic pollution. Biodegradable plastics manufactured from lignin (liquid wood), a by-product in the paper industry, polyesters like aliphatic and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polyesters, and starch-based polymers comprising polymeric material made from milk casein and chicken feathers are considered safer than the man-made plastics readily available. This chapter, therefore, contributes to the sensitisation and creation of awareness to encourage the right practices and policy-making for the realisation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals three, six, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen (3, 6,11,12,13,14, and 15) agendas by the world leaders which is focused on attaining good health and well-being; clean water, environment, and sanitation; sustaining cities and communities from degradation; responsible consumption and production; preserving the climate from the plastic-induced release of greenhouse gases thus reducing the number of deaths; protection of seas and oceans; wildlife extinction; and repairing the ecosystems and biodiversity from destruction. Hence, proper plastic pollution and waste management should be encouraged by the government and established authorities to tackle the adverse health effects of plastic leachates on humans, marine, and soil and also enable the control of the hazardous chemicals leached and transported by plastics that have undermined the health of man and other organisms.},

	abstract = {With the advent of DGNSS, advances in acoustics, radar and laser based position reference systems, and
movement of operations into ever deeper water, taut wire has become less prevalent as a DP Position
reference. However there are still many taut wires in use and it has proved to be a reliable and consistent
means of measuring a vessel’s position for dynamic positioning.
Taut wires compared to other position reference systems are simple mechanical devices. Their use is
restricted to water depths up to around 350m. The factors affecting accuracy are the effects of catenaries
due to self weight of the wire and sea currents, and the ability to maintain a constant tension in the wire.
This paper explores the principles of taut wire, advantages and disadvantages, physical limitations and
various methods of implementation. There is a review of the MTS operating guidelines for tautwires

	title = {Simulation of a coupled system consisting of a non-buoyant remotely operated vehicle and a surface vessel},
	abstract = {This project purports to simulate a non-buoyant Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to
be used for underwater litter collection. This is done as a part of a student-driven project
at NTNU in Ålesund which aims to build a functioning solution to find and pick plastic
litter on the seabed.
An ROV can be used to find and grab underwater plastic litter, however lifting heavier
litter is difficult.
 This is because heavier litter will require more force to lift.
 If this
force is to be provided by only the ROV's thrusters, very large thrusters are required.
This project simulates an ROV which is negatively buoyant, that is it sinks in water,
and tethered to a winch on a floating surface vessel. The project uses Algoryx' AGX as
a framework for simulating the resulting coupled system consisting of a surface vessel,
an ROV and a flexible tether.
 The simulation includes hydrodynamic effects and is
configurable to include weather effects like wind, waves and currents on both vessels.
The results of this project show that AGX is a usable framework for simulating this
type of problem. Additionally the project has created a simulation which is usable for
further work with this configuration of a non-buoyant ROV. Using the simulation, a
simple proportional-derivative controller has been implemented and tested.
The report concludes that the simulator created is useful in further exploration on the
topic of non-buoyant ROVs. The simulator has shown itself to be valid in the use-cases
tested.
 Applications for this simulator include control system development, stability
studies of the complete system, coupled system problems and as an engineering tool to
properly dimension a physical vessel.},

BPA leached from PC tube to all water samples increased with the ascendant of temperature and with the passage of time. The BPA leaching velocity in seawater was the fastest in three samples (11 ng/day for seawater, 4.8 ng/day for river water 0.8 ng/day for control water at 37 °C). BPA leaching velocity from PC tube was significantly high at pH 8 (50 mM Na2HPO4) and increased dose-dependently. There was no difference in the velocity of BPA among the 50 mM phosphate-buffers at pH 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. BPA was leached three times higher by addition of Na+ than K+. However, the higher the K+ concentration, the larger the BPA leached from PC tube. Na+ mixed with PO4− was effective on BPA leaching from PC tube, but not with SO4− or Cl−. The results suggested that BPA leaching from PC tube would be attributed to the concentration of bibasic phosphate such as Na2HPO4 and K2HPO4 in water samples. BPA was degraded in both control water and seawater in the presence of radical oxygen species, but the degradation rate was lower in seawater than in control water, suggesting that anti-oxidative system exists in seawater. Neo-synthesized substance in both control water and seawater in the presence of reactive oxygen species was identified as BPA-quinone by LC–MS.},

	abstract = {In this study, (1) change in the concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) leached from polycarbonate (PC) tube to control water (BPA free), seawater and river water at 20 and 37 °C as a function of time, (2) the fate of BPA caused by addition of H2O2 and Fe3+ to seawater containing BPA leached from PC tube were assessed. BPA leached from PC tube to all water samples increased with the ascendant of temperature and with the passage of time. The BPA leaching velocity in seawater was the fastest in three samples (11 ng/day for seawater, 4.8 ng/day for river water 0.8 ng/day for control water at 37 °C). BPA leaching velocity from PC tube was significantly high at pH 8 (50 mM Na2HPO4) and increased dose-dependently. There was no difference in the velocity of BPA among the 50 mM phosphate-buffers at pH 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. BPA was leached three times higher by addition of Na+ than K+. However, the higher the K+ concentration, the larger the BPA leached from PC tube. Na+ mixed with PO4− was effective on BPA leaching from PC tube, but not with SO4− or Cl−. The results suggested that BPA leaching from PC tube would be attributed to the concentration of bibasic phosphate such as Na2HPO4 and K2HPO4 in water samples. BPA was degraded in both control water and seawater in the presence of radical oxygen species, but the degradation rate was lower in seawater than in control water, suggesting that anti-oxidative system exists in seawater. Neo-synthesized substance in both control water and seawater in the presence of reactive oxygen species was identified as BPA-quinone by LC–MS.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that bisphenol A (BPA) may adversely affect humans. BPA is an endocrine disruptor that has been shown to be harmful in laboratory animal studies. Until recently, there were relatively few epidemiological studies examining the relationship between BPA and health effects in humans. However, in the last year, the number of these studies has more than doubled. A comprehensive literature search found 91 studies linking BPA to human health; 53 published within the last year. This review outlines this body of literature, showing associations between BPA exposure and adverse perinatal, childhood, and adult health outcomes, including reproductive and developmental effects, metabolic disease, and other health effects. These studies encompass both prenatal and postnatal exposures, and include several study designs and population types. While it is difficult to make causal links with epidemiological studies, the growing human literature correlating environmental BPA exposure to adverse effects in humans, along with laboratory studies in many species including primates, provides increasing support that environmental BPA exposure can be harmful to humans, especially in regards to behavioral and other effects in children.},

	abstract = {The current study investigated the chemical complexity of fifty plastic (36) and elastomer/rubber (14) methanol extracts from consumer products, focusing on the association with toxicity in two screening assays (bacteria luminescence and marine microalgae). The chemical composition varied considerably between the products and polymers. The most complex sample (car tire rubber) contained 2456 chemical features and the least complex (disposable water bottle) only 39 features, with a median of 386 features across all products. Individual extract toxicity also varied significantly across the products and polymers, with the two toxicity assays showing comparable results in terms of defining low and high toxicity extracts, and correlation between medium toxicity extracts. Chemical complexity and abundance both correlated with toxicity in both assays. However, there were strong differences in toxicity between plastic and elastomer extracts. Overall, 86–93 \% of the 14 elastomer extracts and only 33–36 \% of other polymer extracts (n = 36) were more toxic than the median. A range of compounds were tentatively identified across the sample set, with several concerning compounds being identified, mostly in the elastomers. While the current focus on plastic chemicals is towards thermoplastics, we show that elastomers may be of more concern from an environmental and human health perspective.},

	abstract = {Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) embryos bind dispersed crude oil droplets to the eggshell and are consequently highly susceptible to toxicity from spilled oil. We established thresholds for developmental toxicity and identified any potential long-term or latent adverse effects that could impair the growth and survival of individuals. Embryos were exposed to oil for eight days (10, 80 and 300 μg oil/L, equivalent to 0.1, 0.8 and 3.0 μg TPAH/L). Acute and delayed mortality were observed at embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages with IC50 = 2.2, 0.39, and 0.27 μg TPAH/L, respectively. Exposure to 0.1 μg TPAH/L had no negative effect on growth or survival. However, yolk sac larvae showed significant reduction in the outgrowth (ballooning) of the cardiac ventricle in the absence of other extracardiac morphological defects. Due to this propensity for latent sublethal developmental toxicity, we recommend an effect threshold of 0.1 μg TPAH/L for risk assessment models.},

	abstract = {Research on ghost fishing became active in the late 1980s. Ghost fishing has been confirmed for traps, gillnets, trammel-nets and small seine nets. Some lost traps are functional for a long period of time, even in shallow waters. Consequences for gillnets after loss depend on seabed conditions. The ghost fishing function of gillnets remaining on flat seabeds declines rapidly with decreasing heights and increasing visibility. Gillnets left tangled around an artificial reef, for example, three-dimensionally maintain the initial magnitude of ghost fishing for a long period of time, even after badly fouled. There are increasing numbers of researches working on the total number of mortality per gear after gear loss for gillnets and trammel-nets. It has become also possible to estimate the total number of mortality for a unit period of time in a certain fishing sector. This paper reviews research which has provided evidence and quantitative data on ghost fishing, and proposes five items important for future studies on ghost fishing.},
