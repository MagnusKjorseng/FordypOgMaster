## This is a translator node between the simulator and the controller
## The purpose of this translator is to take the position from the sim,
## which is given in ROS2 Vector3's, and convert it to standard
## NMEA-GGA messages, similar to the ones that come from the GPS.
## The purpose of this node is to make the controller more agnostic
## This node should not be included and run in the proper implementation.
